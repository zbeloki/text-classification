935		"Cute jeans! flattering and slimming. tts. the cut of the top makes my butt look flat, but oh well, they are super comfy. they are not as short on me as they look on the model. i'm 5;9"""	Bottoms
7414		Great winter maxi. soft and comfortable fabric. good quality. stretchy but not too clingy. fitted in all the right places and very flattering. petite was unavailable so will need hemming.	Dresses
6270	Not a flattering fit	The shirt does have a weird yellow tinge as other reviewers have described. i could get over that if the shirt was a flattering fit which it was not. not worth the money so i returned it.	Tops
15	Nice, but not for my body	I took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly, but i could tell before i put them on that they wouldn't. these are for an hour-glass figure. i am more straight up and down. the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up, i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips - for me. that said, they are really nice. sturdy, linen-like fabric, pretty color, well made. i hope they make someone very happy!	Bottoms
5768	Fun top!	I ordered the orange motif in short sleeves.and i got what i ordered- and love it. it is a little big, but i wanted a looser top. i was looking for something bright and fun for the spring time that i could wear to work with nice slacks or dress down with jeans. this top meets my needs for sure. i really like the detailing on the top collar-bone area. my husband loved that it was bright and cheerful- so i take this as a win!	Tops
9152		I wanted to love it, but it's pretty pricey for a sweatshirt & the key hole in the back with the bright pink ribbon just looks odd. the stitching & beaded detail around the bottom hem & the cuffs is gorgeous, but the sleeves were way too long on me and just looked silly. unfortunately this will be going back.	Tops
17495	Love it!	Great quality, fit and fashion! retailer went back to the days of old with this piece and i am so glad! the piece is classic yet modern - real statement without going overboard!	Tops
15931	This dress is beautiful	When i received the dress, it was true to size on the bust and length. i didn't purchase the petite, but i wish i did since i am 5'2. i tried to wear my wedges, but it's still long. i love the dress and would definitely recommend it.	Dresses
18293	Nice work dress	Very comfortable to wear, love the overall look of this dress.	Dresses
23306	Great transitional top	This is a perfect late summer into fall top! you can easily pair with shorts and sandals then transition to jeans/booties for the fall. it's slightly on the roomy side (i am usually a medium and i had room) but i think that's just the structure of the shirt. off the shoulder style stays perfectly in place!	Tops
5426	Great for fall	Loved it as soon as i opened the box--it's a light-to-medium weight sweatshirt with the wonderfully vibrant flower front. i wasn't sure about the flowers online, but like 'em! the cuffs and hem are nicely made and the v-neck back is an unexpected addition. this will be great with a scarf or alone this fall. can't wait for the weather to cool down!	Tops
10575	Chunky/cute	This is a chunky, boxy sweater. it runs big. the pictures don't really show how over sized the cowl neck is. i love it and think it looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. but the over-sized shape might not work with every body type.	Tops
3857		I bought this item in green and then ordered it in red. very comfortable fabric and flattering by itself or over leggings. these tunics will be staple in my closet. i normally wear a medium in retailer dresses, but i ordered a small to have it a bit more fitted instead of baggy. good decision!	Dresses
19467	Beautiful drape, not too short, runs large	I have a racetrack bra that works with the arm holes (a bit large - like you see on the model), so i am not concerned about them. i may or may not have my tailor tack them in. length was good, knee length (some of retailer dresses are a tad short for my 40-yr old self). shape was flattering. i've some weight on my bum and things, even though i'm small. the back of the dress hung well, not clinging to the derriã¨re. the swing shape didn't overly accentuate my hips. i really love the dress. it's a kn	Dresses
11977	Wonderful!	"This is a great blouse. the fabric is a fine rayon which is soft and has a lovely drape to it. i have found rayon to be a good fabric all year and quite cool in the summer. i am 5'7"" long waisted and 127 lbs with a slender build so i usually wear a size 6--this fits perfectly as well as being quite flattering. it can be worn loose or belted with a contrasting or black belt over skinny jeans. it would also be swell with a pencil skirt. it will cover any fashion flaws! i usually like to shop the s"	Tops
23015	Pretty but not for me :(	I ordered this dress in pm and it was very tight in the top. also, the dress is lovely but the undertones are very gray colored and did not go well with my skin/coloring. it had to go back but others may love it (i have dark hair/olive skin). it also ran a small on top (i'm 38 d). there should be a pm available soon lol	Dresses
11508	Beautiful, versatile dress!	I recently came across this dress in store and decided to try it on. i immediately fell in love. my husband was patiently waiting outside the dressing area to see it and give his opinion but i knew i was going to get it regardless of his thoughts. :) this dress could be worn with heel, flats, sandals, booties, etc. the one drawback i have is the high cut of the wrapover in front. as other reviewers have said, i plan on wearing this places where i won't be sitting for long periods of time because	Dresses
3496	Perfect symmetry in lifesaver colors	"Just got these mara hoffman classic bikini bottoms in flight azure print.today and love them: high quality, fully lined and reversible. the pattern placement is perfectly symmetrical and the colors are just like the online photos.
.
i think the size chart on the mara hoffman site is correct for where the bottoms sit on my body, above the widest part. i have a a-shape with smaller waist and hips, full behind and thighs (currently 33-25-37ish, 38"" at the widest which is at my thighs). in these t"	Intimate
13847		Love this shirt! it runs a bit big, i ordered the (petite) 4 and its a bit long in the sleeves if i don't roll them up, and a bit long and big in the back. but i love the look and it is classic. great with skinny jeans.	Tops
648	Wonderful swimsuit	This swimsuit fits exactly as i had hoped. i purchased it in the teal dot and it is a little brighter than in the photos, but i ended up liking that better. it is well made with thick (but not too thick) lined material. also, i was initially worried that the deep v-neck may be too deep for my liking, but once i had it on,it looked classic and not showy. i love the suit.	Intimate
9263		The blouse is lovely - but after washing it exactly as specified, it shrank more than a full size. this is an expensive hand-me-down for my daughter...	Tops
12191	Amazing pants you won't be sorry you got!	I ordered 3 different styles of jogger pants and these were definitely the ones to keep! true to size and instantly comfortable due to the soft material they are made from. the taupe color i got will go with a lot, too. these are great pants that you won't be sorry you bought!	Bottoms
14330	Love this top!	I bought this top in a large. i washed it in cold water, and it shrank just enough to flatter. the material is great, in that when i washed it, the blouse hanged quite nicely, no ironing needed. also, the material is heavy enough that no tank is needed underneath the top. thakoon had made the same top last summer, and it had cost around $500. this top is even better due to the material, and i could buy it for a fraction of the price. highly recommend!	Tops
12876	Great blue, slimming fit	"I really like this dress. despite the somewhat gathered skirt, it has a clean line and doesn't add a lot of volume around the hips. the blue is a great color. the length is well above the knee but i'm 5'10"". i can see wearing this dress in the fall with leggings or tights and boots."	Dresses
1600	Wanted to love these but didn't	I sized up based on other reviews which was good advice. i am typically a size 6 but sized up to a 10. the pants are very unique and i think on the right body type would look amazing. it seems like someone with curves and a small waist might fit these splendidly...but that's not me. i had some extra material puffing about in the zipper region. i also expected the material to be thicker but found it to be more silky.	Bottoms
5652	So comfortable!	Bought this for a vacation to mexico with my boyfriend. super flattering and soft. big thumbs up!	Intimate
10189	Love this boho dress	I love this unique piece. it is slightly over sized which is intended - cinches allow you to tighten the waist area/providing more definition. will look great with booties in the fall.. great boho dress.. the included slip runs small and short. however, if it's a piece you love, you could easily wear a different slip if you wanted something a little longer.	Dresses
21012		Purchased this in the blue color in the store today. honestly, if i had just seen it online i would not have given it a second look. it really is beautiful in person. the bell sleeves are delicate as well as the pattern throughout the sweater. it fits true to size. i would wear it open with a colorful tank underneath. perhaps if you are very tall and very thin you may opt to hook it closed. the sizing is perfect, it flows and i really have to say you must see this in person to really appreciate	Tops
12045	Nice try...	This top was so pretty online! unfortunately it did not work for me- the front was a bit more shapeless in person, though the back was gorgeous, with a button gather at center. the color appeared yellow online, but was a bit more green in person. also, the armholes were very low, so it would need a camisole or no bra.	Tops
8302	Felt like a weird 80s sweater	"I ordered the red in size m. for reference i am 5'8"" with a long-ish torso. i would have been comfortable wearing the sweater with mid or high-rise jeans but it's fairly short. color was gorgeous. the balloon sleeves and seams just seemed too 1980s in a bad way on me. those with small chests may have better luck. i left like a suburban mom in it."	Tops
13841	So classic!	Great little dress for a picnic. i am a 34dd and didn't have a problem buttoning the dress unlike another previous reviewer. i had purchased a size 8. my only reason for return was the price and my wallet! otherwise this well-made dress would still be in my closet! love the buttons.	Dresses
5730	Great dress for full figure	"Great dress for a full figure.
forget about the horizontal stripes. you can wear this with great style and get away with wearing those dreaded stripes. the possibilities have been great because i wear this dress with sweater vests, athletic vests, sweaters, jackets and wool scarves. i have worn this dress with cowboy boots, dress boots and pumps and it looks great with all options. the material is thick enough that panty lines don't show. women of different ages stop me and tell me they want thi"	Dresses
11859	Fun top	I got the purple version in a xs. i purchased it on sale so it was a great deal. i usually don't wear large prints but i loved the print and the ruffle detail. very feminine. it also hides the tummy roll, so that is always a plus! i've worn it a few times and threads are already unraveling, but easy fix.	Tops
11211	Versatile blouse	"I just got it in the mail and i love it! very versatile piece. wear with skinny jeans and heels or tucked into a skirt. i usually wear a size small but went with what the other review said about a small being tailored and got the medium so i could tuck the front into jeans. i am 5'5"" ,125lbs , a 32dd and wear a size 4 or 27 in jeans."	Tops
21232		Softest cardigan i've had in a long time! fits a little bit on the large side, especially in the sleeve length, but who doesn't love a big cozy sweater? this is a great way to add some color to any fall outfit. highly recommend this one. all i wish is that it came in more colors!!	Tops
22931	Love this!	I love this turtleneck! it's soft (cashmere blend), is sexy with the lace design and loose but form fitting style, and the 70s inspired sleeves are really flirty. i purchased it in two colors because i got so many compliments the first time around!	Tops
4004	Cute dress	I got this dress in neutral motif. looks very cute and the size is perfect.	Dresses
16278		Cute kitty sweater! i'm 5 feet 105 # and went with a regular size xs instead of petite and it hits perfectly!  yes it's itchy it wool! but i plan on wearing mine with a high/low tee under it. so cute!	Tops
5150	Sadly, too big	This top is really beautiful. the color is rich and the texture on the back is a unique touch. and i think it might have worked for me except that i could only find a m/l and it was just too big. i love drapey styles and think this top would have been just the right amount of drapey if i'd been able to snag a smaller size. but the m/l looked like a teal sack, so it's going back.	Tops
19253	Fun retro fabric	The sweater is comfortable and has a little 70s fabric flair...not quite as classically modern as it looks on the model. i am keeping it because it is a true fall/spring item. not a fabric weight for summer wear in california. the peach color is pretty muted, so it is not a show-stopping going-out piece.	Tops
23259		So small! i was a solid size 12 in skirts but recently lost some weight. i was still nervous to buy a size 10 so i bought the 12 thinking i can always take it in if i have to. the 12 - which should have been big on me was tiny. this skirt is built for someone with non-existent hips. returning.	Bottoms
19636	Pretty and easy	"Really love the pattern and color combination. the dress has an attached lining to around the knee. i would say this is tts or a little big. i'm 5'8"" and around 135 and size s fits well with a bit of extra room around the waist. print and fabric cover any perceived flaws and create a long, lean look. i love the feeling of effortlessness--with cute sandals this is an outfit."	Dresses
13909	Too thick	This sweater was pretty short. beyond that, when i raised my arms, the thickness of the sweater caused the shoulders to rise up and stay there when i put my arms down.	Tops
20584	Ok pants	They were ok pants but too small. the texture and shape were not what i expected either.	Bottoms
9255	Perfect fall prep	Love this preppy sweater for fall. only detail i wasn't crazy about was the deep slits in the sides, it gapes a little oddly then around the pocket but not enough of a distraction for me to send it back.	Tops
17973	Lovely top	Purchased in white. very pretty top. i thought it would be more lace - but non the less, it is lovely.	Tops
22384		Purchased this dress at the sale price, with an additional 20% off sale, not exactly sure what to expect-- the print is so different than my usual style preference. so glad i did! while the dress is way oversized (for reference, i'm 5'4, 132 lbs) ordered size sm but prob should have gone with xs) it's stylish, yet effortless. today is the first day of wear (at my office) and already received many complements.	Dresses
19306	Simple beauty	Purchased this in the wine color and love it! the detail at the neck at the bottom hem gives it an extra flair. i went with a small so that it was more fitted. love that it is stylish and comfortable. paired with knee high boots given it length but could also work well with short boots, like the photo.	Dresses
17131	Special	I thought the design of this dress was distinctive, and it did not let me down. there is no zip so if your chesty like i am it may be a little difficult to get on, but i wouldn't sizes up because then it would be too big and balloony. i'm 5'5' and i got the petite which hit me about 2 inches above my knee. material is like jeans and consequently not see-through at all. even though it is quite expensive, there is something special about the dress.	Dresses
1127	Happy girl!	One of 3 pair of leggings ordered and the only pair to fit properly! size l was perfect for me. they stretched nicely going on and the beautiful floral design on the legs didn't get distorted or faded looking from the stretch. wearing these makes me happy :)	Intimate
