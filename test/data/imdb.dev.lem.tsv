r17292	A slight, charming little movie to be sure, but a superbly-crafted one. Gwyneth Paltrow shines in this early showcase for her British accent, and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue. This came out around the time of Sense and Sensibility, and I'm sure I don't know why that one garnered all the Oscar attention. Emma is Jane Austen's most accessible and least stuffy story, told well.	a slight charming little movie to be sure but a superb craft one shine in this early showcase for h British accent and the cast assemble around h all lap up the dialogue this came out around the time of sense and sensibility and i m sure i don t know why that one garner all the Oscar attention Emma i Jane Austen s most accessible and least stuffy story told well	positive
r42317	"This movie is about six men who are assigned to transport money from bank to businesses. Ty Hackett (Columbus Short) was in Iraq for the war serving his country and now just is being helped out making a living by his friend Mike Cochrone (Matt Dillon) making sure he does not loose his house. Mike tells him that this wasn't the life his parents were expecting for him and he should be living a better life than he is now with his brother Jimmy Hackett (Andre Kinney). Telling Ty that him and Jimmy have always been family to him and would do anything to help them out, Mike tells Ty about a plan to make a heist. The money would be around 43 million split six ways among the other transport men too, although Ty does not like the idea he tells his friend Mike as long as no one gets hurt he would be in. The last night Ty was forced to talk to a welfare lady about putting up his brother in foster care giving him a dilemma to lose what matters most in his life. Although the plan sounds safe at first, greed isn't everything when it comes to taking lives.<br /><br />When it comes to heists, your either in or your out, so when you don't go with a plan its hard to play the hero and stop greed driven people when it comes to having large sums of money. This movie comes with a star studded cast to keep you interested starring Jean Reno, Laurence Fishburne, Amaury Nolasco, Fred Ward, Skeet Ulrich, and Milo Ventimiglia. Short I have recently only remembered him in ""Stomp the Yard"" which was about a kid who lost his brother and lives his dream to go to college.

r2690	Forget all those people who tell you it's not as good as the book. So what? This is a film after all. It is a sheer joy to watch, made entirely on location in Cephallonia, gorgeous photography but with dark, disturbing moments as well. The only problem I have is with the obvious miscasting of Nicolas Cage as captain Corelli. Apart from that the film was a very pleasant surprise.	forget all those people who tell you it s not a good a the book so what this i a film aft all it i a sheer joy to watch made entire on location in gorgeous photography but with dark disturbing moment a well the on problem i have i with the obvious miscast of Nicolas cage a captain apart from that the film was a very pleasant surprise	positive
r1043	"This could have been great. The voice-overs are exactly right and fit the characters to a T. One small problem though; the look of the characters, mostly the supporting or guest characters look exactly the same. The same bored look on every face only with minor changes such as hairlines or weight size. It looks kind of odd to see a really big guest star's voice coming out of a lifeless form like the characters here. If I am not mistaken Kathy Griffin did a voice-over for this show and it looked too odd to be funny.<br /><br />There is a few other problems, one being the family plot. The Simpsons did it much better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters got themselves into. Here we get too much annoying diversions, like someone having a weird fantasy and then we are supposed to find that funny but for some reason the delivery is a bit off. As you can probably tell it is hard for me to put a finger on exactly what is wrong with this show because it basically nothing more than a clone of the Simpsons or even more ""Married with Children"".<br /><br />If I should point a finger on what is totally wrong with this it probably is it's repetitiveness. Peter Griffin is not really a bright character but neither are any of the others. Lois should have been named Lois Lame because she is sort of one-dimensional. Seth Green as the kind of retarded son is the best thing about this show and that is the most stereotypical part on the show.<br /><br />So what more can I say.

r27562	"If Hollywood is to be believed, being in the the Navy is nothing but a bludge. Though the sailors may complain in chorus about the monotony of the ocean, it seems that their oceanic duties are completely non-existent, and somehow Fred Astaire finds enough free time during the day to offer dancing classes to a fleet of would-be romantics. Such is the world of Astaire and Rogers. Mark Sandrich's previous film, 'Top Hat (1935),' completely ignored the Great Depression that was then bringing America to its knees, and presented audiences with a glittering world of the rich and famous; it was the film's optimistic outlook on life that perhaps contributed to its success. Likewise, here Sandrich deliberately forgets that the life of a Naval officer is difficult and draining, and instead substitutes the duties of a sailor with an assortment of catchy lightweight musical numbers.<br /><br />""Bake"" Baker (Astaire) and Sherry Martin (Rogers) are two former dance partners whose romantic relationship fell apart after the latter rejected a marriage proposal. After Bake returns from several years of duty in the Navy, he finds Sherry as dance hostess in an unsophisticated San Francisco ballroom. While the two former lovers alternately attempt to woo and rebuff each other, Sherry's plain, music-teacher sister (Harriet Hilliard, looking really quite pretty) receives a complete makeover and tries to charm superficial sailor Bilge ""Bilgey"" Smith (Randolph Scott). There are plenty of the usual screwball comedy shenanigans, a few moments of mistaken identity, and even a hilarious trained monkey that steals every scene it's in. Particularly amusing is the scene in which Bake sabotages a performer's audition in order to create a window for his estranged girl; unluckily for both of them, it is an unfortunate Sherry who drinks the bicarbonate of soda and loses her ability to sing.<br /><br />'Follow the Fleet (1936)' was the fifth winning collaboration between Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and the third (of five) in which Sandrich directed the pair. Irving Berlin provided the film's music and lyrics, and each musical number is enjoyably lighthearted and entertaining, even if they aren't quite as memorable as those in 'Top Hat (1935),' 'Swing Time (1936)' or 'Shall We Dance (1937).' Astaire attempts to break free from his typical rich-man-about-town persona, without much success, but it's hard to imagine the performer without the boyish carefree charm that could only accompany being considerably wealthy. The side-plot of the romance between Connie and Bilge works well with the antics of the two main stars, and Harriet Hilliard (wearing a brunette wig to avoid clashing with Ginger's blonde hair) has a couple of emotional solo numbers, including ""Get Thee Behind Me Satan,"" which was originally written for 'Top Hat.'"	if Hollywood i to be believe being in the the navy i nothing but a though the sailor may complain in chorus about the monotony of the ocean it seem that their oceanic duty are complete non existent and somehow Fred Astaire find enough free time during the day to offer dancing class to a fleet of would be romantic such i the world of Astaire and roger mark s previous film top hat complete ignore the great depression that was then bring America to it knee and present audience with a glitter world of the rich and famous it was the film s optimistic outlook on life that perhaps contribute to it success likewise here deliberate forget that the life of a naval officer i difficult and drain and instead substitute the duty of a sailor with an assortment of catchy lightweight musical number bake baker Astaire and sherry martin roger are two former dance partner whose romantic relationship fell apart aft the latter reject a marriage proposal aft bake turn from several year of duty in the navy he find sherry a dance hostess in an sophisticated San Francisco ballroom while the two former love alternate attempt to woo and buff each other sherry s plain music teacher sister Harriet look real quite pretty receive a complete makeover and try to charm superficial sailor bilge smith Randolph Scott there are plenty of the usual screwball comedy shenanigan a few moment of mistaken identity and even a hilarious trained monkey that steal every scene it s in particular amusing i the scene in which bake sabotage a performer s audition in order to create a window for hi estrange girl luckily for both of them it i an unfortunate sherry who drink the bicarbonate of soda and lose h ability to sing follow the fleet was the fifth winning collaboration between Fred Astaire and ginger roger and the third of five in which direct the pair Irving Berlin provided the film s music and lyric and each musical number i enjoyably lighthearted and entertaining even if they t quite a memorable a those in top hat swing time or shall we dance Astaire attempt to break free from hi typical rich man about town persona without much success but it s hard to imagine the performer without the boyish carefree charm that could on accompany being considerably wealthy the side plot of the romance between Connie and bilge works well with the antic of the two main star and Harriet wear a brunette wig to avoid clash with ginger s blonde hair ha a couple of emotional solo number include get thee behind me Satan which was original written for top hat	positive

r43174	"An independent feature can now be seen as both a work of film art and a video resume. Enter Broken, and aggressively promoted, twenty minute short with style and enthusiams to spare. But is it any good as a film, or does it only work as a demo piece? Ah, there in lies the rub.<br /><br />Broken is the story of Bonnie Clayton who is abducted after awakening from a reoccurring nightmare one night by ""a sadistic stranger and his colorful entourage"" (quote from the video box). As she's held captive, it becomes obvious that her abductors know things about her that even she didn't know about herself. While they question her, a black-clad soldier guns his way into their hideout in an attempt to rescue her. Mayhem ensues.<br /><br />Fortunately for us, director Alex Ferrari seems to know what he's doing, or at least he's very good at faking it. Broken does not suffer from any lack of visual flair, which is especially commendable considering its budget and the inexperience of all involved. What it does suffer from is weak and kind of derivative writing. Think Long Kiss Goodnight meets The Matrix, written ten minutes after reading Fight Club. The good news for Ferrari and producer/writer Jorge Rodriguez is that the story elements are easily ignored for the oodles of eye candy on display. Does the plot really matter that much in a twenty minute short meant to show off the technical skills of its creators? No, not really.<br /><br />Though it would be unfair of me to overlook any negative aspects in light of the films budget and length. Broken is no genre classic. The biggest problem was that it actually would have worked better as a full-length feature. The final ""twist"" doesn't get enough build up time to be shocking. If Ferrari were allowed the time to slow burn the feature as needed, plot elements would seem less random, and the film more complete. Here's to knowing he's getting the chance.<br /><br />Audio Broken's Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation is second to none in the indie world. I've never heard such aggressive surround from such a small feature. The Matrix inspired soundtrack is very rich and deep, gunshots have punch, and even the dialogue gets in on the surround effects. Of everything presented on this disc, it is the audio that speaks the praise for modern independent DVD production. Also included is an equally impressive Dolby 2.0 surround track, which is the menu default.<br /><br />Extras There are literally hours of making of features to be found on this disc. There are so many extras, in fact, that I find it unrealistic to list and describe each of them here, while still expecting my readers to continue reading. Whatever shortcomings the actual short may have, the DVD is unprecedented in its informational resources. People who enjoyed the film can learn all there is to know about its production, including everything from the conceptual art to the promotional campaign. Those with plans to make an indie film of their own can learn just about everything they need to know from these features.<br /><br />The extras are broken down into categorical menus. These include: pre-production, production, post-production, after the short, and cast and crew bios. From a critical standpoint, I found that some of the sections were quite short. Had they been edited into one featurette per menu option, they would've been less frustrating to navigate, as the curser defaults to the top selection with every return to the main section menu. This is, of course, just nitpicking, but perhaps for future DVD releases the filmmakers will take my advice to heart.<br /><br />It has six audio commentaries and hours of interview footage and talented people, and despite the consonant salesmanship, their true colours do shine through.<br /><br />The willingness to share their film-making secrets with anyone who picks up this DVD is quite generous. From the extras I learned what editing and effects software is most reliable and effective, what brand of camera creates the most professional look for the lowest price, even where to get cheap air soft weaponry. On top of this, I was given several alternate options, in case I found myself unable to locate any products used on this particular production. Wannabe filmmakers unwilling to read a book on the subject would do well to watch this DVD.<br /><br />Overall I've scored the actual short as a 6 out of 10, but wish there was an option for feature length potential and effort, because I'd have scored it an 8 or 9 in these fields. I recommend the DVD for its features and as a perfect example of what can be done with a mere eight thousand American dollars.

r21148	I am a HUGE Tenacious D fan, and I think this is not the funniest movie in the world, but the most entertaining. It's not laugh-a-minute but that's not what the D intended it to be. I went into the movie seeing all the HBO shows, memorized both albums, and that made it even more enjoyable. Plenty of inside jokes from past Tenacious D albums, and HBO shows. Since I knew the new album already, I knew 40 minutes of the movie because it is a musical comedy. I would say it has the best first 5 minutes of any movie and the best last 5 minutes of any movie. Hands Down.<br /><br />See This Movie Now!	i am a huge tenacious d fan and i think this i not the funny movie in the world but the most entertaining it s not laugh a minute but that s not what the d intended it to be i went to the movie seeing all the HBO show memorize both album and that made it even more enjoy plenty of inside joke from past tenacious d album and HBO show since i knew the new album already i knew minute of the movie because it i a musical comedy i would say it ha the best first 5 minute of any movie and the best last 5 minute of any movie hand down see this movie now	positive
r8166	"We all have friends. Some of us have more than others but there really are only one or two people that you feel really close with, people that you can say are like your brother or sister. Alice ( Danes )and Darlene ( Beckinsale ) are like that. You can see that from the beginning. They graduated together, they go to parties together and they decide to go to Bangkok together when they were supposed to be going to Hawaii. They also get busted for attempting to smuggle drugs into a third world country and that spells disaster. The rest of the film is about survival and not giving up hope. It also has a strong message about the power of friendship and what it can mean to someone.<br /><br />Brokedown Palace is a very good film, it is not excellent and that is due to a few issues that I want to talk about. But first I want to say what is good about the film. And for starters the acting is top notch, and you can look no further than the two leads. Danes and Beckinsale are perfect in the roles that they have. Alice is always fiery and seems a little rough around the edges, but she seems more fun than Darlene. But sometimes that fun can get her into trouble. Darlene is always a little on the conservative side and although that can get irritating sometimes, it would have served the two girls better if her way was adhered to instead of Alice's. Bill Pullman is adequate as the American lawyer living in Thailand. The film is photographed very well also. The inside of the prison while not the same as Shawshank or Natural Born Killers or Return To Paradice, but it does show the necessary ( but underdone) hopelessness of the situation that they are in. Johnathin Kaplan's direction is quite good as well. We see the two girls struggling to make it through each day but you can see their spirit is being put out a little more each day. Brokedown Palace is excellent when it talks about friendship and it shows how they have to rely on each other to survive. The other thing that I had to comment on is the soundtrack for the film. It heightens and compliments the mood of the film to perfection. The song that you hear in the trailer is also played in the film and when it plays you feel the plight of the women in this prison. You can feel how alone they must feel and how desperate they are to get out and get back to the simple things in life. And it also makes you look at yourself and realize how lucky we are to live in the society that we do. We have it easy compared to some country's and believe it or not the music is a perfect catalyst for reflection on this subject. Some of the music is done by a group called Delirium ( I think ) but it is Sara McLaughlin( wrong spelling, but how do you spell her last name? ) that does the lyrics and her voice is beautiful and haunting and it adds so much to the film.<br /><br />What I didn't enjoy about the film was some of the stupidity that the girls exhibit. I won't say what it is that they do but when you see it for yourself you'll know what I am talking about. Also I didn't really feel that the prison they were in was all that bad. It looked more like a minimum security prison and that may be because when there are similar circumstances in other films that invlove men doing time in a foreign country, the prison scenes are always brutal and sadistic. But I didn't get that here.<br /><br />Overall this is a great film and it really does make you ask the question, "" How far would you go for a friend? "" That is a tough question and maybe one that none of us could honestly answer until put into the same situation. Let's just hope that it never comes down to that."	we all have friend some of u have more than other but there real are on one or two people that you feel real close with people that you can say are like your brother or sister Alice Dane and Darlene are like that you can see that from the beginning they graduate together they go to party together and they decide to go to Bangkok together when they were supposed to be going to Hawaii they also get bust for attempt to smuggle drug to a third world country and that spell aster the rest of the film i about survival and not give up hope it also ha a strong message about the power of friendship and what it can mean to someone palace i a very good film it i not excellent and that i due to a few issue that i want to talk about but first i want to say what i good about the film and for starter the acting i top notch and you can look no further than the two lead Dane and are perfect in the role that they have Alice i always fiery and seem a little rough around the edge but she seem more fun than Darlene but sometime that fun can get h to trouble Darlene i always a little on the conservative side and although that can get irritating sometime it would have serve the two girl better if h way was adhere to instead of Alice s bill Pullman i adequate a the American lawyer living in Thailand the film i photograph very well also the inside of the prison while not the same a or natural born kill or turn to but it does show the necessary but underdone hopelessness of the situation that they are in s direction i quite good a well we see the two girl struggle to make it through each day but you can see their spirit i being put out a little more each day palace i excellent when it talk about friendship and it show how they have to rely on each other to survive the other thing that i had to comment on i the soundtrack for the film it height and compliment the mood of the film to perfection the song that you hear in the trailer i also play in the film and when it play you feel the plight of the women in this prison you can feel how alone they must feel and how desperate they are to get out and get back to the simple the in life and it also make you look at yourself and realize how lucky we are to live in the society that we do we have it easy compare to some country s and believe it or not the music i a perfect catalyst for reflection on this subject some of the music i done by a group called delirium i think but it i Sara McLaughlin wrong spelling but how do you spell h last name that does the lyric and h voice i beautiful and haunting and it add so much to the film what i t enjoy about the film was some of the stupidity that the girl exhibit i won t say what it i that they do but when you see it for yourself you ll know what i am talk about also i t real feel that the prison they were in was all that bad it look more like a minimum security prison and that may be because when there are similar circumstance in other film that men doing time in a foreign country the prison scene are always brutal and sadistic but i t get that here overall this i a great film and it real does make you ask the question how far would you go for a friend that i a tough question and maybe one that none of u could honest answer until put to the same situation let s just hope that it never come down to that	positive
r24325	George Cukor directs a brooding and cynical classic. The distinctive Ronald Coleman is at his best in this piece of Noir about an actor who loses himself in his roles. The acclaimed Anthony John(Colman)has driven his wife Brita(Signe Hasso)away with his highly fueled temper and erratic behavior. But the two manage to continue working together to please their audiences. Things begin to change as John is becoming bored with his career; he reluctantly agrees to play Othello. He gets deep into character as a jealous and murderous man. He begins walking a thin line between illusion and reality and ends up confusing his role with his own life and eventually kills his mistress(Shelley Winters),but has no memory of the dastardly deed.<br /><br />Colman seems faultless in this role. Winters is very impressive as the young woman determined to get away from her squalid life. Also in the cast: Edmond O'Brien, Ray Collins, Joe Sawyer and Whit Bissell.

r37660	"This is it. This is the one. This is the worst movie ever made. Ever. It beats everything. I have never seen worse. Retire the trophy and give it to these people.....there's just no comparison.<br /><br />Even three days after watching this (for some reason I still don't know why) I cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie is/was. Its so bad. So far from anything that could be considered a movie, a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence.<br /><br />This made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good. It made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe. This type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society. We should be ashamed. I really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art, is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good. It's an embarrassment. I don't know how on earth any of these actors, writers, or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making ""Loaded"". I don't know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of movies.<br /><br />That being said, I love a good ""bad"" movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, they are HILARIOUS. I tell all my friends to see them because they are ""bad"".<br /><br />But this.......this crosses the line of ""bad"" into a whole new dimension. This is awkward bad. This is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen, every line, every action, every death, every sequence BEFORE they happen; and not just like a second or two before, I mean like, after watching the first 5 minutes before.<br /><br />Every cheesy editing ""effect"" is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point. I really never want to see the ""shaky"" camera ""drug buzz rush"" effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or ANY FANCY CUT EVER AGAIN EVER. This is meticulously boring, repetitive and just tortures the audience.<br /><br />But.......and let me be specific here, the most DISTURBING thing about this movie is that given the production, it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement. I personally will grab the shoulders of the director if I ever see him and shake him into submission, demanding that he run home and swallow two-gallons of Drain-O or I will do it for him.<br /><br />If we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad, just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again. Trust me, I think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time of sitting through this.<br /><br />Stop these movies, they are just the most vile of all facets of our society. Please. Stop. NOW."	this i it this i the one this i the worst movie ever made ever it beat everything i have never seen worse tire the trophy and give it to these people there s just no comparison even three day aft watch this for some reason i still don t know why i cannot believe how sane horrific this movie i was it so bad so far from anything that could be considered a movie a story or anything that should have ever been create and brought to our existence this made me question whether or not human are truly put on this earth to do good it made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress a a species in this universe this type of movie sincere hurt u a a society we should be ashamed i real cannot emphasize that our global responsibility a people living here and create art i that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortion of our reality for our own good it s an embarrassment i don t know how on earth any of these actor writ or the director of this film sleep at night knowing that they had a role in making load i don t know what type of disgusting monster enjoy watch these type of movie that being said i love a good bad movie i love shark attack 3 i love bad taste they are hilarious i tell all my friend to see them because they are bad but this this cross the line of bad to a whole new dimension this i awkward bad this i the bad where you know everything that i going to happen every line every action every death every sequence before they happen and not just like a second or two before i mean like aft watch the first 5 minute before every cheesy edit effect i shameless used over and over again to a sickening point i real never want to see the shaky camera drug buzz rush effect or jump cut or swerve cut or any fancy cut ever again ever this i meticulous boring repetitive and just torture the audience but and let me be specific here the most disturbing thing about this movie i that given the production it appear that a somewhat decent amount of money was actual put to this excrement i personal will grab the shoulder of the director if i ever see him and shake him to submission demanding that he run home and swallow two gallon of drain o or i will do it for him if we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prison abroad just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again trust me i think they will become more extravagant with suicide method aft the 72nd time of sitting through this stop these movie they are just the most vile of all facet of our society please stop NOW	negative
r49359	there was some truth to this movie. I remember a story reported 15 to 20 years ago of 4 fisherman finding a body in the water and they chose not to report it until their trip was finished. I also recall they were charged with interfering with a corpse (or some such charge). I'm not sure if it was in Australia. The viewers outside of Australia must think we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders. Wolf Creek and this film would encourage this perception. The film itself reminded me of A Simple Plan. But as far a being one of the best Australian films ever, as someone claimed, I can't be that generous. Put it this way, I wouldn't bother watching it again.	there was some truth to this movie i remember a story reported to year ago of 4 fisherman finding a body in the water and they chose not to port it until their trip was finished i also call they were charged with interfere with a corpse or some such charge i m not sure if it was in Australia the view outside of Australia must think we live in a country full of rapist and serial murder wolf creek and this film would encourage this perception the film itself mind me of a simple plan but a far a being one of the best Australian film ever a someone claimed i can t be that generous put it this way i t bother watch it again	negative
