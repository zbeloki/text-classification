13637	I love this dress so much i almost said a bad word	Omg, i am 5'8 size 14, big hips and i simply love love, love this dress! when i first saw myself in the mirror i just loved the way it fell and gypsy style of it. the material is rich and soft. i caught it on sale under a hundred bucks and it is more than worth it!	Dresses
7365		I don't normally like how i look in rompers but this one was so cute i had to try.  i was pleasantly surprised that it fit great and was comfortable too!	Intimate
12695	Best in cream	"I ordered this in grey first but didn't care for the black lace ---- so, decided to try the cream/beige/neutral and i just love it. i have areas i am trying to ""cover up"" and this really fits the bill without looking too much like an oversized tunic. the back is the clincher. different and surprising. washes excellently, but i did line dry as i was afraid of shrinkage. if there are any left you won't be sorry and the neutral color looks good on almost everyone!"	Tops
3094	Had potential	On the mannequin this looked adorable. it is made well but if you have any bustline it just billows out below like a tent and is not flattering. if it had less fullness it would have been really cute.	Tops
12705	Strapless denim a-line dress	"Such an adorable and comfortable dress! just love the fit, the design and the comfort of the denim fabric. it's quite flattering, fit's true to size and i can't wait to wear it to casual parties all summer long! highly recommend! lots of
options too with dressing it up a bit more with fun high healed sandals or a pretty shrug and just as nice to wear with flip flops or keds! i 5'5"" and usually a size 4 and it fit true to size....grab it while you still can!"	Dresses
1160		I love this dress. it is so soft and comfortable, perfect for summer!! i wish it came in more colors because i would buy everyone!!	Intimate
21682	Lovely skirt!	Love this skirt! i have worn it to work with a simple black shirt for a great outfit! i have had many compliments on it. it is very flattering and comfortable!	Bottoms
18676		This is a cute dress, but not for me. 1. i think it runs very small, 2. it is super textured so if you don't want to add bulk (aka pounds) to your frame, this probably isn't for you. it's too bad it's online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first. i'm sure it's probably adorable on smaller, thinner people. unfortunately, mine is going back.	Dresses
13747	Great fabric	"Bought this for my 21 year old daughter, and she loves it. the blue color is very pretty and she says she gets lots of compliments and requests to ""touch it"" because the fabric is gorgeous. it's a bit boxy, and a little short to wear as a dress for her 5'9"" height - she says she risks showing her undies when she raises her arms. but she likes is so much she's just keeping her arms down. :-)"	Dresses
51	Love	"I absolutely love this bib tee! it's probably my favorite retailer purchase of all time. i'm 5'7"", 140 pounds and the small was a perfect fit for me. i typically wear either a s or m tops."	Tops
18588		Awesome top. slightly cropped. great to dress up jeans or wear with pants or skirt for evening out.	Tops
4278	Sized up and perfect!	I tried this on in the store and was sad that the small was a little unflattering around my mid section.  couldn't stop thinking about the dress though, so checked reviews online from home...many said to size up. i ordered a medium and it is perfect! fits so nicely now and the fabric is so cozy!! i thought the top would be too big in a larger size but it still looks good.	Dresses
3460	My cup of tea	"Thank you, retailer, for creating this sweetly vintage and feminine sweatercoat. the boiled wool is lovely and the embroidery makes me lightheaded just looking at it. this is definitely a nod to retailer's past, and i love it to bits! 
i usually wear a size s or xs, but bought this in the xs. the fit is flattering as can be. i was so happy to find a fitted and timeless piece in the sea of boxy and trendy sweaters.
(it's true that this sweater isn't lined, but to my mind, it would be a crime"	Tops
13105	Love the fit	Love how this fits. length is great so i didn't need to hem (you wouldn't be able to). flattering on muscular/athletic legs/bottom. i bought in navy and then had to buy it in another color it fit so well.	Bottoms
12986	Disappointing	I really liked this dress in pictures online. i wanted to wear it to work on casual fridays. everything about this dress was a disappointment, especially at this price point. the fit was weird: tight in some places, too loose in others (i'm usually xs or s, i ordered this one is s). it's made out of a fairly thick and warm material, yet the neck area of the dress is more exposed than it appears in pictures, especially in the back, making it awkward to have this very warm dress with neck, upper b	Dresses
2918	Get it now	"This skirt is so much better in person than in the pictures. fit is true to size, perfect drape, lined & not clingy, just perfect in every way. it's at such a decent price point too that i think it will sell out--grab it now in your size while you can! 

only ""con"" i can think of is that it might be a bit long for petite sizes, but maybe they make it in petite...?"	Bottoms
20168	Fun tshirt design	Actually you would think just another tshirt but actually with the wide straps it changes it up enough to really be cute.  i like the look it adds.  i really want to get more colors.   i normally wear everything from retailer in small , and even though this fit it was small for a small.  i will keep it but i think i will buy others in medium.	Intimate
16467	Can go either petite or not	"I tried on te regualr size (xs) as that is all they have in my store, and decided to get them anyway, even if a little long on me. why? because htey are so cute rolled up with the yellow color showing!

super comfortable, have not washed htem yet, but hipefully they remain a decent wuality."	Intimate
16346	Love this sweater....	Only negative thing is that it sheds. and even that is not really very negative! i would buy it again in a heartbeat.	Tops
8218	Dress up or down	I love how you can wear this with a t-shirt or blouse.	Bottoms
16638	Elegant blouse	Shirt fits great! i wore it for work and got lots of complements. looks very elegant. i also got the pants featured on the model since i liked the outfit so much ;)	Tops
19770		"Tried the navy in store. boy does it run big! i'm normally a size 6 / small (ish). 5'6"", 34a-28-36. the xs was still quite boxy on me while the sleeves were well fitted. i understand this is the style and i like the design with the different sleeves.
it was a no buy as the main fabric was already pilling in store and looked a bit cheap - sorry!"	Jackets
4823	Cute top, but uneven fit.	I tried the black cat pattern in the store and it was cute, but the sleeves tend to run quite slim while the bodice is loose. so be aware you may want to size up if you ever have issues with tight sleeves.	Tops
3963	Beautiful dress	Casual dinner out dress love the color, mine is navy.	Dresses
3620	Fit	I loved the design and light weight quality. reference i'm 5'4, 125..i ordered a small, it's a tad big but i can handle it. because of the neck line, you must wear a strapless bra.	Tops
14168	Great jean love mother	Love these vintage soft jeans.. they do run small so be sure get a size larger.. i am typically a 27 and i ordered a 28... look amazing with boots, flip flops and slip ons... love mother jeans.. work every time	Bottoms
1191	Odd shape	This was so unflattering. the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs. the green was a beautiful, vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag.	Dresses
14262		Beautiful top but it didn't fit. i am small chested with wide shoulders, normally wear a xs or s - ordered the xs and it swallowed me.	Tops
8462	Weird neck fit	There is no possible bra to wear with this top. after one washing the neck felt funky. the pink color is very light. it's long enough for leggings. my shirt is a high hemline on one side than the other. i'll wear it but wish the neck wasn't so funky.	Tops
4486	Great lbd for the winter	Usually a m, ordered a s and sp. the sp fit well. comfortable/flattering. fit note: picture makes it look like nude lining is a lot shorter, it is not - this was true in both sizes. great holiday/nye party dress. i disagree fabric feels cheap, but hem off pattern/not even. worth it on sale but not full price.	Dresses
10506	On the right person, maybe?	"This wasn't for me. i have a short neck and am 5.3"". the length was fine on the one i tried on, but other proportions were off. it was too big around, in the middle, yet tighter at the bottom. on me, this made it resemble a large bag. the neckline stood up on mine. even when i pushed it down to resemble the picture here with the model, it still felt like a whiplash collar (coming up over my chin). i gave it four stars for quality since the material is so soft."

19123	Cute dress!	I love the bright red color and also the texture of fabric. it's light, soft and crisp, which is perfect for summer days. the dress is definitely designed for people with a short torso. the waste line is a bit high for me, but overall it didn't feel weird or look funny. there is just something about this dress that made me very difficult to part with. once i tried it on, i had to bring it home with me!

10786	Stylist	These pilcro jeans are so very cute. i usually wait for a sale to purchase the pilco jeans, but i didn't want to chance them not being available in my size. the pilco jeans seems to sell out fast. the cotton material is very soft but not sloppy. you will love the embroidery down the side of the leg. they do run a bit big. i purchased them in one size smaller for a slimmer fit. i would suggest one size up if you like them more baggy.	Bottoms
1026	Best sweater jacket!	Love this sweater jacket! super comfortable and warm. i am 5'2 and i got a xs petite. it fit perfectly both in length and in the sleeve. the green color is super rich and is perfect for the season. it's easy to wear it up and wear it down. i appreciate that it's not super bulky, which was what i was afraid of. my favorite jacket of the season so far.	Tops
4085	A true classic	This is my kind of clothing item. i love linen, stripes, pockets and a loose look in an over piece. it has the lining to give a good hang to the coat. linen may not be for all but i do like the look of the fabric. i feel this is true to size giving you the loose look and not a slim fit. the sleeve length is just perfect for this look and finishes the overall style. it does not have any neck closure which may bother some. i have never purchased from this maker so took a chance in quality but am p	Jackets
1593	Gorgeous big floral	"This is a beautiful dress, considering it is made from polyester. that being said, the material has a nice finish and looks like it could be silk. it's a flattering cut (other than being a tad short-waisted) and hangs well. it was also a bit tight through the bust. unfortunately, if you are on the taller side, it tends to be high waisted and short in length.my daughter is 5'11"" and a size 10. the medium fit best, although because of the length, she is reluctantly returning it. sad, because it ha"	Dresses
17911	Falling for fringe	Simply lovely to look at because of the fringe detail and it's a joy to wear because it does not cling to my trouble spots.  very versatile as it can be worn and layered in many different ways.  i was lucky enough to buy this in petite but i'm sure the regular would've been fine.  looking forward to outfitting this because i got so much inspiration from instagram.	Tops
8563	Grandma sleeves	Super cute sweater and i was totally excited and then i looked at the sleeves (which are not shown in the pictures). what you can not see are the dragonfly (sequins and sparkly beads suitable for women 4 and 84). ugh. too bad - going right back.	Tops
14592	Flattering	I love this dress-i have it in the other color (black and white) but now i see this color scheme and i think i may actually like this one better. i love the wider stripes near the waistline which gives it a slimming appearance. the knotted look gives this dress a beachy feel which gets me in the mood for summertime. i love that the pattern is bold, but the color scheme allows this dress to still stay in the casual category and still be insanely flattering. i love that i could wear this dress eve	Dresses
16537	Beautiful dress!	This dress is beautifully made, and has a lovely sheen to it. it's elegant and can be worn on different occasions. it's a very feminine dress. i ordered the dress in a few sizes and a size 2 fit me the best as i have a small bust line.	Dresses

4508	Love it!	Love this dress! the material has a softness to it - just love it! can't wait to wear it this summer. fits true to size.	Dresses
2860	This product was great	Great color fit was very true to size	Tops
14879	I love this shirt	Perfect fit. though it is shear i found that i could wear it without a cami. i absolutely recommend this shirt. it fits tts.	Tops
8666	Looks better on	I wasn't sure about the dress on the rack. lace can either look amazing or make you look like a doily. it was on sale so i figured why not? let's try it on. it is gorgeous on. true to size. i am usually a 0 and the 0 fits me perfectly. the quality and tailoring is amazing. it is a heavier dress with the lace and lining so it may not work on a super hot day. overall, i love the fit and quality of the dress. i love it even more on sale!	Dresses
445	So much better irl	When i ordered this little jacket i knew i would like it, upon arrival i fell in love. it is a little edgy with leather detailing and with stretch in all the right places, the crop is super flattering. appeared online to be a bit more of a sweatshirt material but it has so much structure and holds its shape!	Jackets
17303	Love it!	Love this top. great twist on a traditional plaid. looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. i get compliments on it every time i wear it.	Tops
22607	Gorgeous, soft hoodie	I bought this in the neutral motif, and it's exactly as it appears online except a bit more vivid in real life. the colors are ivory with dusty pink and blue/gray puffs of color. the fabric is incredibly soft. i usually wear a small in tops but went up to a medium and i'm glad i did. if you like things really fitted, i guess you could order your normal size, but since i wanted this to have some room for long sleeves underneath, i went with the medium. this zip-hoodie is great quality and it look	Intimate
