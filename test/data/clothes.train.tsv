1756	Great fit, alluring	"I love this dress so much. the fabric on top is not something i would have chosen-it is thick and almost an elastic kind of feel. but i have grown to appreciate that since this dress is not amenable to most bras. i think the fabric would be thick enough on top to actually just do without one. otherwise you would have to go with a strapless-and the right kind of strapless, with this dress.

when they say it flares it really does-and much more than i was expecting. the bottom part of the skirt f"	Dresses
11742	Beautiful fall vest	The material is velvety smooth, and not quite so pink as pictured on the website. more of a dusty brown rose. well made, nice fit. flattering on my petite frame. a wonderful third piece to complete or elevate an outfit.	Jackets
18175	Pretty in person	This dress is much prettier in person. the embroidery is very beautiful and the slight sheen to the material gives it a dressier look than i expected. the lines are simple, flattering without clinging or choking. it is a nice versatile dress that can be casual or fit for party.	Dresses
14980	Runs very large	I instantly fell in love with the graphic pattern on this drapey layering piece, and i've received compliments every time i have worn it. however i seriously considered returning it because the way the garment is cut causes it to bunch awkwardly at the sides. maybe it's still just too big--even though medium or large is my size in tops, the medium in this sweater clearly looks baggier on me than it does on the model in the photo, for instance. it is definitely not slimming, but the striking patt	Tops
17091	Slip pass this one	A truly unwearable slip: scratchy fabric, bunchy skirt, teeny bodice. it feels like you are wearing wrapping paper--the foil kind.	Intimate
13619	Beautiful and relaxed	This is a gorgeous dress. the fabric has the look of linen (though it is not) and the lining is a soft mesh. looks both relaxed and stylish.	Dresses
2102		I love, love, love this absolutely stunning dress. the only problem was that the zipper was very difficult to maneuver, and when it finally went up, the watch it was attached the lining of the dress made a bump in the dress, which was very unflattering on an otherwise very flattering dress. i tried on multiple versions of this dress and had the same design issue with each. i ended up returning it because it bothered me so much.	Dresses
1215	A little itchy for me	I tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight. the material was a little itchy on me (but maybe its because the chest was tight). the color is lovely (pink). im sure someone will love it but if you are petite, i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty.

6183	Cutest romper	"This is the cutest romper ever !! very high quality.. 
it has always been a challenge for me to find and love rompers. but this fit beautifully.
i cant wait to wear it this summer."	Bottoms
11759	Beautiful and unique	"After a long wait for this dress to come in. i finally received it! the wait was worth it!

the colors and pattern are just like they are online. the length comes right to to the top of my knees...i am 5'7"". a couple of things to note: the sleeves are narrow,. if you have skinny arms, no problem. the fit across the bust is snug enough that if you have a large bust, there will probably be a gap at the buttons. there are gathers at the shoulder giving the sleeve a slight puffed shoulder. if you"	Dresses
17289	Runs large, too much fabric	I thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is. there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top. the fabric will most definitely snag, as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin - not very good quality. i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge, everywhere but the neck.

15056	Beautifully created	Lovely socks, great color, stitched well, a little thin	Intimate
17412	The perfect t!	This is my go-to shirt. perfect for layering, perfect for around the house or perfect for topping an outfit with a scarf. the white is a little sheer but it's fine for me.	Tops
7801	Quite versitile.	I ordered an extra small. it fits with both a humble tee and a button down with the sleeves rolled up. i've tried it with jeans and also joggers and heels. really a cute and versatile sweater. i got the olive but can see where the black might be more universally useful. this one works perfectly for me, however	Tops
19308	Awesome pants!	I tried these on when they were full price and waited for them to go on sale and was very excited when they did! i'm not the type to buy leather pants but these look like i can dress them up or down and dress them like jeans. i'm a size 26 in pants but i bought size 25. i highly recommend!	Bottoms
3705	Too much fabric	This is definitely a personal preference review. i loved this dress when i tried it on. it's really beautiful. however, there was just way too much fabric on the sleeves for me. i know it's the style and i have similar style dresses, but i felt really large in this dress and it all came down to the sleeves for me.	Dresses
8077	Perfect dress	This dress is a great color, fabric, and the style is very flattering! i'm wearing to a wedding but it will be great for many events this fall! dressy enough for a cocktail party but could also wear to church!	Dresses
6534	Arms too long and waist too short	Loved the color and the deshn. but when i put on, did not look right. waist was too short and the arms were long.	Tops
14555	Love the style!	"This top runs large. i am going to return the medium i ordered for a small. 
i wish it came in different colors. i love the style."	Tops
7261	Too narrow	"These socks were so narrow, especially on top, that they pinched my thighs and we're almost painful to wear all day. my thighs are pretty narrow, i'm only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body. i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they don't slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny. ""one size"" is definitely not true. they also snag easily."	Intimate
12243	Even better in person!	I'm 5' 120 and the 4p fit like a glove. i have a bigger chest and there is no pulling on the buttons. the colors and fit on the dress are perfect. i had so many compliments when i wore it!	Dresses
3717	Love this sweatshirt	This is a great staple for laid back weekend wardrobe. the inside of the pullover is soft, like sweatshirt material, and its comfortable enough to sleep in. also cute enough to wear out with jeans. i would definitely recommend this sweatshirt. i'm typically a size 0 in retailer - i ordered this shirt in a size 1 and i love the fit.	Tops
16857	Pretty- soft fabric and nice color.	I tried this in the store and i liked it. the color is very pretty and the fabric is soft and drapey and feels like good quality. i like the little subtle dots. i ultimately did not buy it because the tie at the throat is not my style and because i just don't need this kind of piece enough in my wardrobe at the moment. but it is a very nice top and i would recommend it if you like the color and style.	Tops
18566	"White tee with a ""detail""on back"	I ordered a small. i'm usually a petite small. i like my tees not fitted. i will exchange it for an xs. soft. it has like the look of a seam down the middle of the back. i barely noticed it. i think it makes a plain tee shirt a little unique. good quality. 100 percent cotton. it's a white tee. soft.	Intimate
3764	Cute, casual top	I love the button details on this top. i was expecting the material to be thicker, but it's quite thin. it isn't sheer, but i will layer it for the winter months. overall the fit is true to size. i am 5'0, 110 lbs and the xxs fit me well. the arms were more snug than shown on the model and the shirt was loose without being too flowy or boxy.	Tops
5301	Must have	It's is an absolutely gorgeous dress, one of a kind . you must have it in your wardrobe . my seamstress needed to adjust it just a tiny bit but it's truly fits to size and is emphasizing the figure.	Dresses
6792	Love!	"When i first saw this shirt in person i was shocked because the lines on it are sparkly and colorful.  now that i look closely at the shirt online i see that, but i did not expect it cause it wasn't as obvious in the online photos.  it is much more prominent in person.
i ordered it in my usual size and it fits perfectly - just like the model, definitely oversized but appropriately so.  the length was also great (i'm 5'8) which made me very happy."	Tops
5435	Simple yet stunning	This pullover is a great purchase. the color is simply stunning and is very comfortable.	Tops
9370	Beautiful dress. small in the bust	"This is a find! i am always on the hunt for a unusual lbd so when i found this on a ""found and collected rack"" i went for it. for starters, i am 5 foot almost 6 inches, and it the length ends just about the same place on this model. i usually wear a size 2 but when i tried on the size available in the store (oo), i felt i only needed a bit higher sizing bc i am small in the chest. i am barely a size 34 a and probably a 30d at best, and i barely can squeeze my chest into this dress at this size!"

10522	Floral dress	"One of my favorite dresses in retailer!
floral prints caught my eye at the first sight, so i had been desperate to have it!
it looks pale on picture, but in reality, it is brighter than you imagine it would be. 
along with soft, floral, pretty color, i like the design of skirt. 
compared to the front, length is longer on the back.

12895		The skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip. even though it has a built in slip, it is still see through. the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt. if it wasn't see through i would keep it.	Bottoms
8543	Vintage , cozy, unique adorable sweater	I agree with the others...this is the type sweater that hooked me on retailer ten years ago. i love my new sweater. i do recommend wearing a long sleeve tee underneath. the sleeves are itchy.	Tops
833		Great, special cardigan. fits like a shrug and a little short but is perfect over a tight fitting sheath. great for broad shoulders.	Tops
1177	Beautiful summer dress	I was unsure about this dress when i first tried it on. the color is gorgeous, it is flowy and beautiful. it hits just below the knee (i am tall), which is something i am not used to. i hadn't decided on it, but my husband loves it and that's all that matters! it is very feminine and pretty. i normally wear a 0, but ordered a 00- it fits just slightly loose, which is the style this dress is going for.	Dresses
1027	Not for every body type	"I am 5'6"", 130 lbs with an athletic body type and i ordered a size small. these were really baggy in the thigh/quadricep area and made my thighs look bulky. the fabric quality is very nice and i like the idea of them for curvier body types. my son commented that they looked like pajama pants and i agreed."	Bottoms
20925	Can be dressed up or down	This shirt is as cute on as it looks in the pictures. i love the fit and felt great in it on a mom's night out with jeans and heals. i also think it could be dressed up for work or further down for a day out and about! love it!	Tops
3054	Great skirt, runs small	I definitely agree with the other reviews, however i really like this skirt because it will go with a variety of tops to dress it up, or down, as well as color options. the tricky thing is that it runs super small. i'm usually between a 6, or 8 (28/29), and ended up getting a size 10. i don't like high waisted skirts or pants, so it sits just below my navel and is very comfortable. maybe best to try on in store, but worth it!	Bottoms
3841	Pretty	The colors on this are beautiful! i have wider hips and thighs and this blouse just looks too boxy on me. i ordered a size down and from that aspect it fit. however, it is too flowy and boxy for my body type. i considered keeping it for layering but even on sale, it is too expensive for this purpose. i'm so bummed because the colors are so pretty!	Tops
19231		This dress is so short! i double checked to make sure i didn't get a petite by mistake.  i'm 5'10 and ordered an extra small because of the deep v neck. it fit well on top, but  you could see my underwear in the front. seriously, i dont even think miley cirus would wear it that short. the lace was really beautiful so i was disappointed that it didn't work out.	Dresses
21358	Best top ever	"I own quite a few pieces from retailerplogie but this one is my favorite by far! the color is a crispy white. the length is just right and has a beautiful flow to it. it is more fitted on top but flares out for a feminine appeal. i am 5' 1"", 115 lbs. i bought the regular xs and it fit like a nice tunic top. perfect for a curvy figure- i wore it with my tight jeans and boots. got compliments from everyone!"	Tops
13230	Great dress!	Super easy and cute. i received lots of compliments!	Dresses
1262		"This dress is great! it fits true to size and the pockets are very unnoticable!
my only note is that the first picture of the dress show the dress to be a bit darker than the actual dress. the dress colour more closely resembles that of the other two photos."	Dresses
3395	Adorable!	"I ran into retailer to actually return a dress and saw this hanging in the petite section and had to try it. at almost 5'4"" i can sometimes go between regular and petite sizing. and thankfully i could grab the petite with this dress. (they didn't have the regular size) it's airy and summery, i love the design of the swing. it's loose, but not tent like. the length came to about 3 inches above my knee. it's not see though at all! i had black bottoms on and you couldn't see them. another plus it tha"	Dresses
16582		"I love holding horses and i am always be size 2 in their clothes (32dd, 5'3"", curvy). i ran into my local retailer to grab a shirt they had on hold and had to try this on because it's so cute. i couldn't get the 2 zipped and it seemed to be rather narrow in the torso. such a bummer!"

20801	Beautiful	This dress is simply gorgeous. the slit is just right, the colors are great, and most of all the fabric is very comfy! i highly recommend!	Dresses
15046	Cute topper	I love boiled wool paired with classic silhouettes and this bonette combines best of both. the fabric is soft, not too substantial but still warm for my climate, goes great with many outfit combinations, has a flexible cut for my body type. i chose to to buy the size small and while it's a little tight in the upper sleeves (because my upper arms are chubby) i can work with it when i wear the right top. the medium was a just a bit too boxy for the profile i wanted but i may get it any way in the	Tops
11734	Even more lovely in person!	I've been stalking this top online and finally went into the store today to see it.  i'm so glad i did!  the colors are very vibrant and the material is soft and very lightweight.  the cut covers a regular bra pretty well (a big plus!) and makes my arms look good!  i can't wait to wear this, it will be a perfect dressy top for the higher heat days!	Tops
12078	Spandex, not tweed dress	I was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed, not the same colors as the picture, spandex material, the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped. i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress.	Dresses
19874		"I fell in love with these online. i thought they would be such a nice piece of statement denim. unfortunately they did not work for me. i am 5'2"" and the waist of these paints was four inches away from my breasts. it didn't look bad from the back but from the front it was comical. the denim itself is nice and heavy but, like the previous reviewer stated, not a dark wash. the pair i received was a medium whiskered wash. if i was taller these would have been a yes, despite the wash discrepancy."	Bottoms
7599		I didn't realize it had a tie around the waist. it seems too much material hanging in the front to tie at the waist. unfortunately the sash is attached and cannot be removed. it's very cute; just not for me.  i will have to return (but sure i can find something else)!	Tops
7954		Size up!!! this dress is great quality and so flattering but tight in the arms and chest. ordered in my usual xs and will regretfully need to return it.	Dresses
10921	Pretty dress	I love this dress but sadly for me it didn't look good on my body type. i'm a 36 dd and not thin so it made me look like a beached whale. i saw it on two different sales clerks in the stoe and they both looked adorable.	Dresses
2974	Large, long, and lovely	I like this top because it covers the bum.  it is a little longer in the back than front.  it is cotton modal soft, and it is light enough for summer.  the ruffles add nice flow and fun detail. i bought this piece because it will make a nice top to wear in the summer, but classier than a tank top.  i also knew it would make a nice layering piece under a sweater in the winter.  i buy all my clothing pieces now based on versatility, material (for comfort), and classical style.	Tops
18504	Sad :(	I love this top so much online. i received it yesterday in the mail and unfortunately i am very disappointed.  there is nothing wrong with the quality but i do think it looks more appealing online. also, this top is probably not for anyone with a large chest. it looks nice and drapey on the model. when i put it on it just makes me look fat and the top (thanks to my 38dds) looks more like a swing top. i'm sure it's a lovely top on very thin people with a smaller chest.	Tops
12539	Beautiful, but very short in the waist	"I loved the color and lines of this jumpsuit, but found it to be far too short in the torso. (and about 8"" too long in the leg, but that's a lot easier to fix.) i tried sizing up, but it still wasn't working for me. i'm only 5'7"", and while i'm long-waisted i can usually make jumpsuits work. if you have a short torso and long legs, this is a beautiful option. otherwise, i can't recommend it."	Bottoms
7265	Flattering	I like this top a lot, and have always liked knotted looks around the bust area. i do not have a large chest, and this kind of top always draws attention in all the right places. i was worried the cut would be too low for my comfort level-and it is low but the shirt does not come away from my body in normal movements so i do feel completely comfortable wearing this without a cami underneath. i don't prefer this in black because i think the color detracts from the bunches of fabric created by the	Tops
18916		I went into the store to buy this in white after seeing it on the website. i ended up with the blue/gray color. the white was completely see thru. could have worked as a swim cover- but not at this price for me. the blue on the other hand is fine. the fabric is soft and hangs nicely. you can definitely dress it up with some booties and a belt, or keep it laid back with flip flops. i'm sure i'll wear this a bunch this summer. the color is versatile enough that i will pair with leggings and boots	Dresses
9012	Great quality tank	I love these tanks. the straps are wide enough to hide my bra straps. they're soft. and long enough to give me added length to shirts that run short. because this tank runs small and i had to size up to get the fit that i like, the straps are a little long, but after i alter them with a little sewing, they're perfect. i've had to do this with retailer tanks in the past, and it's worth it to me for the quality that i'm getting. the regular price is too high, so i only buy them on sale. i try	Intimate
4972	Very pretty, lovely color, nice fabrics	"This dress is really beautiful, cheerful, the color lovely, the fabric soft and beautiful. i wish it had worked with my body because i really liked the style, fabric, and color. i am 5' 5"" with long legs and a shorter upper body, so i needed to buy this dress in a petite size, but they were sold out of petite smalls and mediums. so i tried the small in a regular size. the armscye (depth of arm hole) is so low that my breast was completely revealed! i thought about shortening the straps entirely"	Dresses

2552		Matronly and unflattering. i think this may work on a very tall and slender body type.	Tops
17673	So sad to send it back but...	Wow was this top huge on me! i am usually a large, but lean towards xl when things don't have stretch. i sized up out of fear that my bust couldn't squeeze into a large (36dd) and i didn't want the buttons in the back to gape. when i took this out of the package (i purchased the blue) i knew right away it was way too big. looked like it could fit my husband. the sides poofed out so far, i looked ridiculous (if you look at the photos, the model is trying very hard to control the poofiness with he	Tops
6396		These looked so cute and colorful! very sad to receive them yesterday and having to return them today. cute overall, but run large. depending on cut/style, i range from 2-4 in bottoms. i ordered a 2 in these, and they were just way too big. i would exchange for a zero, but i bought them for a trip this weekend. oh well.... consequence of online shopping!	Bottoms
20210	Love it	I bought the deep maroon which is beautiful. absolutely love the softness, length and the casual look. you can dress it up and dress it down. it does run big. i got the medium but could wear the small easily enough. since i am 6 feet tall, i wanted to length to be where it is. the only part i did not like is the 3/4 length sleeves as it is tough when wearing a jacket over it.	Tops
3833	Cute design, poor quality	This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer, but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest, cutest tees, but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.

16240	Polka dots	I thought this top had shimmery dots, that is what it looks like in the picture. but when it arrived, it looks much plainer in-person and i could not believe it was this top. the dots are polka dots. the embroidery at the v-neck doesn't stand out much in the photo but it does in-person. the top runs true to size but the fit didn't feel as perfect for me. i am sending it back. i needed a more shimmery top.

Originally i bought this in black and white. recently purchased several more in different colorways . why? it's just perfect to wear as an under tank/cami. i'm a busty gal and sometimes cami straps can be too thin and dig into my shoulders. this is soft, smooth and provides just enough coverage. very flattering fit on its own as well. great under loose knit or low cut sweaters. love!

14008	Fits like a sack of potatoes!	I tried this dress on in the store. i loved the fabric and color, but the fit was huge, no matter how much i sized down. there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose, but this was shapeless in an unflattering way. i was attracted to the style and color, but the execution left much to be desired.

5909	I'm a lil disappointed	"Wish someone warned of the navy one being not as pictured!! i ordered the navy because the crocheted part appeared to be more intricate than the ivory. in reality the navy knit is just like the ivory. it seems well made but very delicate. i'm not a fan of tops (especially pricey ones) that require a camisole but this top is a very ""retailer"" piece so most likely i will keep it, just a bit disappointed."

Dresses
21773	A dud for me	Loved the colors (greenish, coal and white) and shirt texture but the fit was horrible. i sized up to an xl because you can never tell sizing with this line. that didn't help. it fit, although a bit long but the deal breaker was that i looked huge from the side view. since i carry my weight in my mid section, high/low cuts on the side are tricky on my frame. it fit well in the bust over my 34g's and looked nice from the front. i do recommend it. if you have my body issues you might pass.

20065	Easy	I first bought this top in the dark grey, loved it so much that i ordered the navy too! the quality is amazing as always, and fit is perfect (some may say it runs large, but i'm pretty sure it is meant to have a looser fit). i love the material of the lighter color blocked back. it's so versatile and easy to throw on. i've worn it simply with jeans, and i've also paired it with a pencil skirt and overlapping skinny belt and heels for a great work outfit (received compliments!).

14393	Very soft and cute design	The material is so soft and i really like the design (i got the map one). as others mentioned, sleeves are quite short, almost morel like a muscle tee than a t-shirt, but i don't mind. looks really cute under a cardigan for fall too.	Tops
15886		This shirt is so cute in the picture but not so great in person. i bought the short sleeve version this summer and loved it! this runs really big so maybe a smaller size will help.	Tops
16768		Got lots of complements on this one. worn to work with skinny pants and a chunky necklace. classic look with a twist. would also look adorable with jeans as shown.	Tops

1810		I love this dress! perfect for both work and play and can be worn in all seasons thanks to the sleeves.	Dresses
7028	Gorgeous	"This is truly a lovely dress. the colors are beautiful and i love the contrasting but complimentary fabrics which add interest to an already elegant dress. the material is substantial without being stiff so that it flows gracefully and it flatters the figure.
in my opinion if fits true to size, i'm 32b, 5' and 103lbs and i got it in a 2p which is the size i normally get in dresses. it is slightly more loose than other retailer dresses in the same size but it still follows your curves without being"	Dresses
9056	My favorite tee	"This tee is my favorite this year! it just looks great on! not fitted, but not loose either. i love it so much i have it in white, black, pink, light green, gray, slate blue and holly. the holly was my least favorite color (i thought it would look a little 'greener') it is so dark, you almost have to see it in the sunlight to be sure it is green. i ordered it online from the store and i kept it just because...

i love the fact that it can be machine warned and dried without shrinking. i don't dr"	Tops
21619	So close, but the cut is not good!	"I have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great. i'm 5'4"" c chest and athletic build - the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them. i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy. there was tons of room in the chest, but it was tight in the shoulders. i really wanted to love this, but there's just too many cut issues. it is a good length for work though."	Dresses
17912	Wanderlust sleep pants	Cozy and beautiful - everything dreamy sleep pants should be. great for gifting. make bedtime feel a little more pampered.	Intimate
5559	Easy wear!	"I found this in store last weekend and thought it was it perfect. i got the size small which had plenty of space for me, usually a 4-6 or small (34a-28-26).
it's long, i found it to be just below knee length (5'6"").
if you zoom in, you can see some detail work along the front edges which complements the pretty openwork in back.
it has pockets too btw :)
this will be worn over everything this summer, let's hope the poly/rayon/spandex blend washes ok!"	Tops
23138	Beautiful spring dress	Cute spring dress. fit can be a little challenging if you have a full bust. however, print is so beautiful. the material is soft. i liked the puff in the sleeve. it made the look more unique.	Dresses
22470	Easy breezy	This dress was so comfortable, i wore it all day - to church, out to brunch and actually slept in it. it would travel well, too.	Intimate
16146	This sweater truly is sleeping on snow	It is my favorite piece in my closet right now. it is cute. it feels like a pillow. i just want to sleep in it, but i also want to wear it out so that i can show it off.	Tops
4752	A perfect dress	"This dress is extremely comfortable and looks great on. i'm 5'3"" and 34dd and the m petite fit like a dream with even a bit of room at the bust. the length is perfect with sandals or even up to 2-inch heels. perfect for travel and summer entertaining!"	Dresses
1028	Best for staright figures	"This is a beautiful dress but if you have any hips at all you may find it difficult to find the right size. i usually wear a 0-2 p and found that that the op was too snug on the bottom while the 2p was too loose on top. ( for reference 32-26-35). so if you are perfectly proportioned it could work for you.
also, note that this is a pencil dress....very slim fitting.....probably best suited for a cocktail party."	Dresses
8447	Cute. loose. comfortable. great for summer.	This definitely runs a little large, but i love this tee.  i actually went back and bought it in a second color. it's perfect to throw on with shorts this summer.	Tops
6078		I absolutely love this sweater....it is perfect for fall	Tops
6587	Love this dress but definitely size down	"I saw this dress in my local retailer store and had to try it on. i cannot say enough good things about this dress! i love it!
 like other reviewers said it runs very big. i am 5'8"" 138 pounds and usually wear a size 6 but got this in a 2. fits like a shirt dress should once i sized down."	Dresses
8172	Pretty dress	This dress is exactly what i was looking for for fall events. can be dressed up or down, flowy, suede-like fabric. i normally wear a small in most retailer pieces and even though i am pregnant in my first trimester i bought a small in this since it is stretchy and will fit me at different stages.	Dresses
11121	Much prettier in person	I bought this top for my mom for christmas. i wasn't sure if she would like it, but it is really nice in person and she loved it. it fit true to size and can be dressed down, as it is on the model, or dressed up. i am so glad i decided to get this top. highly recommend.	Tops
19846			Dresses
11728	Not as good as i hoped	This was a fail for me. although i ordered size large it barely fit my midsection when tied and was too small in the waist. the fabric is nice though. best on thinner frames than mine.	Jackets
10934	Great quality, amazing dress	Swing dresses can be so iffy but this one is fantastic! i sized down to an xs due to the chest area (i'm usually a s/6 up top 36b) and it fits perfectly. the dress is so comfortable and stylish without feeling like you're wearing a tent. this is the most i've ever spent on a casual dress and it is worth ever penny. could not be more happy with my purchase.	Dresses
9832	Retro diner girl chic	When i first tried on this romper, i grabbed a 6 (my normal size) but because of my bust size, i could not even get the top half to cover me at all. i decided to give this romper another go a month later, and tried on the 8...it made all the difference! i love it, it fits amazing, and it is just too cool.	Dresses
942	Cute, but no sale	The dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling. the fabric will only get worse with wear. return. cute concept; poor fabric quality.	Dresses
1809	Droopy front, heavy fabric	"Right out of the bag, this top didn't really match the one pictured here (it is the right top, though). the fabric was heavy and felt ""damp"" -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd.
and the fit is nothing like what's shown on the model. the ""v"" is not fitted or nicely wrapped (or even tacked in place) -- it was just two loose, droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged (i'm neither ""flat chested"" nor ""busty"""	Tops
5609	I love these	I noticed a xxs p at the store. i thought they would never fit me since i am an xs, but i decided to try for fun and to my surprise they fit perfectly. i love it! very stylish and flattering.	Bottoms
3313	So warm and cozy	"I love this cardigan. it's quite luxurious and roomy and long in the front, leaving lots to wrap around yourself. the back is more cropped
and slim fitting to help balance. this is so soft and warm, i love it. definitely bulky and cozy, not fitted. but perfect for a casual look. i'm usually a medium in sweaters but got a small in this, and it's still a little loose which is perfect."	Tops
1913	Perfect summer crop	"I will be living in these this summer! i couldn't find them in my local store, so i was pleasantly surprised when i received my grey pair from my online order. the fabric feels so comfortable with just the right amount of stretch and the cut is very complimentary to those of us with athletic thighs. i was so pleased that i bought a black pair and discovered they look adorable with my tall boots and a black boxy sweater. they've already become my ""go to"" pants. everyone should have a fun pair of"	Bottoms
15199	Cute little two-in-one	"Bought this top on a whim on a tops sale and am really glad i did. it's a nice two-in-one piece that can be dressed up for the office with a blazer or down with jeans and a sweater. striped portion of the shirt is a ponte stretchy material. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and the small was perfect and even roomy (i don't like things too tight)."	Tops
18382		Gorgeous shirt! the detail on this shirt is impeccable! even with its boxy shape, it was very flattering on my petite, curvy frame. i'd say this shirt runs just a tad big. i'm 5' 118lbs and the xs fit perfectly.	Tops
22557	Fantastic!	"Best ""jeggings"" ever! they look and fit like skinny jeans but feel like leggings. soft but substantial fabric, nice dark gray, worn in color."	Bottoms
18278		"Bought both colors - nice quality top, but they do run large. for reference, i'm 5'4"", 115lbs and xs is still kind of big on me. wish they have xxs."	Tops
15729	Red sweater	This is an awesome pointelle sweater. i love angel of the north sweaters. i bought the small (34b) and it fit tts. the pleats in the back hang without pulling. it also flatters the figure with it's shaping. it is a lightweight sweater in a great shade of red. just love it!	Tops
12754	Classy meets simple	I love this shirt! it fits great and looks awesome with shorts or skinny jeans. i love the beads on the shoulders. i liked it so much that i ordered it in 2 colors.	Tops
2457	Cute summer tee!	I originally ordered the peach stripe tee in my normal size, medium. after going to the store and trying another color on in a small i realized i should have sized down. i have since purchased the blue stripe in the smaller size. i love the fit and the colorful stripes of both. great light-weight, casual tee. i love the button details on the shoulder.	Tops
13343	So mixed on these	"I'm obsessed with the cut and style. being 5'11"" i don't have a lot of good jean options to wear with heels. these jeans are amazing fit beautifully but the fabric quality doesn't seem to be there. after 2 wears the seam started separating at the crotch. and thus wasn't the case where i was trying to wiggle into pants too small. i ended up returning but may give them another shot at some point."	Bottoms
10261	Roll-ups that are versitile	These are great pants! i sized up from my typical size 28 because i found the rise to be a little low for me. i tend to like my pants a little higher on my waist. the sa said these ran a little smaller for most. when i got home, i put them up to my size 28's and they were the same. (what woman likes to go up a size?) i purchased the black;great for work and play. i would like the holly too but i am waiting.	Bottoms
18960	Retailer from the days of yore and yesteryear	Like other reviewers, when i saw this top in person i was struck by it. i would never have even looked twice at it online. i hardly ever buy things at full price from retailer but i treated myself to this one. the only thing i'd disagree with is that it runs true to size. at my store, there was only 1 left (in a size 10). i'm usually a 4/6 but i figured i'd try it on since the style is loose anyway. and the 10 fit very nicely. i did try a 6 in another store and found the slits came too high and th	Tops

9331	How beautiful is that!	"This is a treasure and ""must buy"", friends! tiny designs the most amazing blouses and shirts, and i feel stoked to have gotten this one. the level of detailed embroidery on the front and tiny silver and gold sequins on silver net lace at the shoulders is artistic and well-designed. i've always found the tiny brand to be predictably one size small, but, when i get past my ego and order one size up to a large, i am sooooo satisfied. this sartorial work of art is completely lovely! i have a busty f"	Tops
5660		I actually found this blouse to be quite nice. i'm not sure that i'd wear it as a tunic, though. it looks great tucked in and the print is fun but nothing exhilarating. for the price, i expected more.	Tops
7580	Insanely gorgeous	I picked this dress up to take into the dressing room to try on without looking at the price tag. im typically a small and he dress in store was an xs but because of the wrap i figured i'd try it anyway. this dress is to die for! the xs fit me just fine (though the snap at the chest wouldn't stay closed but i thought it looked ok). i looked at the tag after falling in love with the dress but left the store without it. i'm contemplating purchasing it still because i can't stop thinking about it!!	Dresses
10149	Love it	I have to agree with previous reviewers in that it is a bit short on the top but i kind of like that as i am petite and most tops come way too long on me; however go up a size if you have any breasts at all. likely they will not fit in you standard size. however i just love this shirt. soooo adorable. the color is a bit more olive than brown to me though than what is in the pic :)	Tops
3792	Dress is extremely pear-shaped.	"I bought this dress in an xs, and am 5'4"", 115 lbs, and fairly proportional. the shoulders were snug, but the hips (and maybe waist)were at least 2-3x too big. comically so-- the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side."	Dresses
1967	Mustard	"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40. i'm normally a size 10, but i took a 12 in this skirt.

2. it's comfortable and has pockets that you can really put your hands in.

3. sits at high waist. hem hits below the knee.

4. i didn't like the buttons. they are very round and stick out quite far. they are also mismatched. i would have liked them better if they were flatter.

5. i also didn't like the mustard color. it's unflattering to me."	Bottoms
4669	Beautiful tank	The colors on the tank were beautiful i didn't keep it because i have a few similar tops, but i liked it! fits true to size with an a line shape	Tops
16956	Clown pants	"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40 and the size 30s fit me perfectly.

2. i like the regular hyphen chinos and the stet chinos, but these pleated ones looked like clown pants because the pleats widen the hips and the ankle cuff is very tight compared to the regular hyphen chinos.

3. i hated the mustard color. not flattering to me at all."	Bottoms
21496	Too roomy in the bust for me	"I ordered this in my usual retailer size, xspetite and it was too baggy in the bust. granted, i'm only a 34aa, but i would still expect it to be a little smaller in the bust at that size. the elastic waist was a little loose too (i have a 26"" waist, 34"" hips) and the inner slip showed a tiny bit like another reviewer said but it's the same fabric as the dress. the slip is adjustable but it's attached to the dress at the waist. it wasn't flattering on me in the hips either. this was a miss for me b"	Dresses
21694	Meh?	I bought these a great alternative to black jeans but they are headed back.  the texture is nice but let's call them what they are- thin, leggings.  not worth the price in my opinion.  honestly, i can't seem to find a pair of pilcros that i like so i'd spent the extra money on a better pair of black jeans.	Bottoms
17991	Odd fit for me	"I recommen only becuase i like it on other people, but not on me. the pull on style didn't work, i need xs petite to fit lenght and waist, but the waist wasn't elastic enough to ""pull up"" (i have let's say a booty#. i kept hearing hte stiching give... it also looked a little too poooofffy on my frmae, i am 5'1.5"" and it stuck more out than on the model. nice idea, btu not for me. #i am 115 lbs#"	Bottoms
18527	Pretty, but very big	"I am not one to complain about things being cut too big as i generally don't mind lose and flowing. however, this dress is very ""bell"" shaped and the fabric is just thick enough that it doesn't really lay well, at least not like it does in the photo. i bought the earth-tone color way and i felt like i was wearing a macrame version of the liberty bell. it is also a lot shorter than i was expecting. if it weren't so short, i would try sizing down. it is very good quality and the slip is super soft"	Dresses
15212	Flattering cut	Really like these -- they fit really well and look great with a pair of chucks and a sweater if i'm dressing down a bit, as well as with flats and a nicer blouse. really versatile. i'm kind of pear-shaped, and these seem to minimize my flaws a bit, too, so that never hurts!	Bottoms
2523	Great fall dress	"I tried this dress on in the store.  i wear either a s or xs in retailer clothes.  its loose fitting, so i went with the xs.  the arm holes were tight, but have very cute buttons if you look closely at the picture.  you can also roll the sleeves up and there is a coordinating plaid underneath, which adds a nice touch.  great length, not too short or too long.  the grey color is much prettier in person.  i felt it had a little more of a blue tint. for reference i am 5'6"", 124 lbs, and 32b."	Dresses
17539	Comfortable, long, cool	The dark orange is a beautiful color. this is a very comfortable dress, lightweight, long enough so you can sit down in it without any concerns. unfortunately, it's dry clean only, and you may want a belt to cover the elastic waist. the top part is very loose, so this might work better for full-figured gals.	Dresses
17218	Gorgeous	This shirt is nothing like the online pictures. it's a stunner in person. ended up with the black one though i was torn between it and the white. i would agree with some other reviewers that it has little to no give across the chest so i bought a l due to broad shoulders. the m fit like a glove and i was afraid it might tear if i raised arms or reached for something. not sure if a large busted girl would be comfortable. though i sized up, it didn't affect the way it hangs and it hangs beautifull	Tops
18818	This top runs both small and true to size	"This top has a lot of potential (comfortable, easy to wear) but it's cut too small in the area above the bust. i tried the top in small, medium and large (i usually wear s or m in retailer tops) and couldn't get that area to not look tight or like it was pulling. you can see it on the model, too -- that space right above the bra near the armhole. i think you'd need to order a size up to get that space to work but then the top will start to look too big on the bottom.

19484	Definitely cuter on	This dress didn't do much for me on the hanger but it was on sale and thought i would try it on in the store. so glad i did, definitely cuter on than just hanging there. the back has a belt feature that adds a little structure. the colors are nice and bright. will be good for our hot austin summers.	Dresses
388	Great with leggings!	"I really like the appearance of this item, and it looks pleasing with many different styles of leggings. it does run a little large. i am a ""true to size"" small, and this hangs on me a little, but i love the design of the back. it is so soft and comfortable!"	Intimate
3926	Polka dot perfection	This dress is super sweet, but also unique with the reversed fabric on the skirt. it is true to size, unlike a lot of retailer clothes that seem to be boxy/run big. the fabric bunches a little bit at the waist though -- that's my only complaint.	Dresses
14535	Beautiful concept. failure in reality.	"Beautiful floral print and while i like the concept of this dress it was a total failure for me. where the knit meets the print hit me at the top of my bust, truly a disastrous look for a bustier figure since the fabric just drapes down and made me look much larger than i actually am. same with the arms, if the white knit had carried down to the elbow it would have elongated the arms instead of cutting them off mid biceps to make them look like giant hams. i'm 5'6"" and a classic size 8 and this"	Dresses
20665	Extremely delicate top	I so wanted to buy this top - especially during the 30% off tops sale this past weekend - so it would have been just about $100.  but while it was well made, i could see it easily snagging or getting caught on jewelry.    if it was on sale even more, i might have considered it.  it could be extremely versatile, with jeans, black skinny pants or leggings.  really loved it, but couldn't see spending that much money on it.	Tops
5568	Huge	"I knew there was a problem when my dress arrived and the small fit perfectly when i was 9 months pregnant...i even bought a small even though i normally wear medium
i bought it for family pictures once my daughter was born but it made me look like i was still pregnant even though i had already lost all the baby weight in 3 weeks.
it is a beautiful dress though and may try to get it altered to see if that works"	Dresses
6088	Soft, thin summer vest	"I like the way this vest looks: it's flattering and the color is nice, just like in the pictures (i got the orange one). i am 5'7"", 125 lb, got size s, and i am very happy about the fit.

just keep in mind that the material is very soft and thin. it is good for summer, but i expected the material to be more... firm... something to be worn on cooler windier days. also, the vest does not close - i would prefer the vest to have a zipper or buttons.

but if you need a fun and cute summer accesso"	Jackets
22770	Amazing pair of leggings!	The fabric is super soft and the quality is just exceptional. the pattern/coloring is even more beautiful in person. overall an excellent pair of leggings to work out in or run errands in.	Intimate
14569	Completely amazing!	I rarely buy anything at full price at retailer. but, after trying this dress on last weekend i had to buy it because i couldn't handle the thought of not having this dress in my life! i'm 5 feet tall and a size 12, so this was definitely a maxi on me. but, there is just enough room at the bottom that i can safely wear it with flats. i'm very pear-shaped and this dress is extremely flattering on me. even my husband agreed that i needed to buy it even though he hates my shopping/clothing add	Dresses
11811	Cute top!	This top looks better on than on the hanger. i've been looking for a feminine plaid top and this is the one! it's a flirty and innocent look in one. i would say size up. it runs a little tight around the upper arm, shoulders area when stretching arms out. i normally wear a size 2-4 depending on the top and the 6 felt better.	Tops
20846	My dream chinos!	"They have all the features i've been searching for:
the leg is straight, not tapered or fitted. the fabric is soft, with an authentic worn-in look. the overall look is casual, relaxed and cool. i love these chinos and definitely plan to buy more."	Bottoms
788	Happyinpdx	Has quickly become one of my 'go to' tops. comfortable, cute, looks just like the picture.	Tops
11843	Beautiful fit and design.	These shorts are great, both the design and fit are beautiful. i would say that these run true to size, i bought my usual size, 26, and they fit perfectly. they fit a little high waisted, which i love. the material is so soft and are so comfortable. i would recommend these shorts if you're thinking about it!	Bottoms
17230	Awesome, stylish blazer	I tied this on a whim, thinking it was a big 80s on the hanger, but it is so cute and hip, i fell instantly in love. the material is amazingly soft and generally doesn't wrinkle. i wore it for my thesis presentation and it went flawlessly! it has a very light light-grey window pane print on it that looks great with grey pixie pants, white pants, and the blue is light enough you could even pair it with black bottoms and jeans. a total catch, and the fun layover in the back is just an added pop of	Jackets
21269	Beautiful top!	I bought this top for my 15 year old daughter, and she thinks it is beautiful. it's very comfortable, and good for days that are not too cold, but not too warm. lovely!	Tops
2220	Comfort	Extremely comfortable t. fits tts. bought in black & teal. can be dressed up with a scarf or worn with just jewelry. fairly lightweight so probably not a good choice for cold winter months. great price too!	Tops
18168	Beautiful, flattering high-quality dress	"This dress is a home run on all accounts. the embroidery is gorgeous, the fabric is high-quality, and the a-line cut is slimming. i found this dress to run true to size. i am 5'11"" and the length hits above the  knee--so it could be longer on shorter heights. i purchased the white dress initially and now have also ordered the navy."

4551	So soft, so versatile	Beautiful blouse that can be dressed up or dressed down. online shows as purple, but the black mortif is be true black background with pretty floral colors. i rarely wear floral design, but this blouse make it work. the material is such a soft rayon material. love, love, love.	Tops
6923	Lovely dress	I saw this dress in the window in the santa barbara store and fell in love with it! it is described as a robe in one post i saw but i think it looks so much more like a great fall/winter maxi. in the window display it was paired with a cognac leather belt which made it look even better.	Intimate
5477	Easy flattery	Flattering even for a 50+ year old body. the lavender is subtle and pretty (it's a blue-ish color) and the sweater skims the body nicely. i have a broad back and some delicate sweaters make me look unwieldy; this one is minimizing. sleeves are long, but not too much so. i usually wear an 8 and the m fits well.	Tops
19478	Great dress!	"Love this dress! i agree with some of the other reviewers, the arm holes are a little low but not a deal breaker. i'm 5'8"" 120lbs. and ordered the xs and it fits perfect. would definitely recommend!"	Dresses
5347	Size up for comfort	Maeve really keeps me guessing on sizing...usually too big, but this one is too small in my normal 4, so i went with the 6 for comfortable movement while still maintaining the intentional fitted look. fabric is of beautiful quality, colors are true to the picture - just a gorgeous timeless dress that i imagine wearing to many special events, or with a denim jacket over it for work :)	Dresses
12136	Very nice!	This top works very well with a white or green cardigan for work. the color is more green than in the photo and it is wider on the bottom. it hides a non-flat stomach very well without looking matronly. i ordered a small petite, but i am heavy on top so i did not find the armhole problem that the other reviewer had. my only con is that i don't love the high-low thing that every retailer top seems to have these days, but i can live with it.

4985	Don't size down if you're busty	I took everyone's advice and purchased a size small instead if medium.  i wish i had gotten my usual size as the neckline and bodice is very tight.  i'm top heavy with a wide rib cage and 36dd's.   other than that, the skirt of this mango hued beauty is large loose and flowing which i can see why people suggest sizing down.  i think my fit problem would be solved if petite was available.

i am forced to return the shirts but since i do like the shirts i am goi"	Tops
15665	Such a nice design....	This top could've been one of my favorites ever. i ordered the rose option and was planning on ordering another color. the fabric is super thin but i was able to wear w/o an extra tank. unfortunately after 2 wears, several small holes appeared around the neck/under the ruffle. i washed this top on hand wash cycle and hung to dry. when i came to read the reviews, i noticed i wasn't the only customer with this issue.

19372	Had potential, better suited for someone taller	I was really excited about this skirt because i love the color. however when i tried it on, it was too much of a high/low. i am not very tall but this would look a lot better on a tall person.	Bottoms
21666		I am in love with this skirt! it is the most flattering thing i have purchased in a while. the fabric is a beautiful medium weight knit with a good amount of give. it hugs your curves but doesn't cut in anywhere! i was able to easily go down a size from my usual. i love it so much that i am going to order the other color as well!

3491	Ordered two	I took a chance and ordered extra one for my daughter-without ever running it by her first. i'd first seen the sweater in the store when another customer was tracking it down. it looked so nice and unique i couldn't forget about it even though i didn't try it on at the time. very happy i got it on sale-and so i got two-luckily we go to our different workplaces in different towns!

5038	Just knew i would love this!	I have had this dress in the shopping basket on my retailer app and was dying to try it on in the store. luckily, newbury street in boston had it so i stopped by yesterday. the dress is everything i hoped and even better! the cut could not be more flattering. to get the nice, classic fit in the front, i stayed true to my usual size (4) but worried the buttons would be straining like another reviewer said. as soon as the bow in the front is tied, it keeps everything together and is very comf	Dresses
7477	Every vest has different coloration	The material is so soft and cozy. there is just enough padding to keep me warm all year round in southern california. but, i ended up leaving the store without this vest  bc 1)the cut is slightly boxy.  2) every vest had different color variations. you definitely should go into the store to check it out. the ones i saw made the vest have cheap pattern of wide stripes, not an even vintage fade as shown. i'm so sad as everything else is perfect. fits true to size	Jackets
8261	Cute shirt, not worth price point	This shirt was cute and fit well- true to size- but i felt for the material, it was not worth the $68. the colors offered were a little drab. i thought the grey could work for me, but it didn't. the neck hole looks a little sloppy for a $68 shirt- the roll doesn't lay flat all the way around. would be better priced in the $30-$40 range.

I saw this gorgeous blouse in a store over dark blue jeans on feb. 19. of course, the store stock only went up to a size 12. typical. with the way the 12 fit, i knew i had to size up from my usual size 14, and i did. i ordered it in a size 16, and it arrived on monday, feb. 22 -- with lightening-fast speed. it is breathtaking and fits wonderfully. i like the top button undone, the buttons are gorgeous, and the blouse is very retro, circa 1973, but you definitely have to go up one size. the only	Tops

11860	Cute top	This is a cute top and i did not even need my usual petite size thanks to the 3/4 length sleeves. i liked the semi-abstract sailboat pattern and the style is comfortable to wear. however, the tie at the neckline didn't appeal to me so ultimately i did not buy it.	Tops
17842	Very pretty blouse; sleeves impractical	I normally wear an xl, but could only find this instore in size large. the blouse fits nicely, but i think it would come down a bit lower and also be a longer blouse if i would have purchased it in my usual size. the blouse itself has a nice drape to it. the black 'railroad tracks' look very pretty in person, and add a nice detail. the only complaint i have with this blouse is the sleeves. the enormous bell sleeve feels like a costume. but for a nominal fee i had the sleeves shortened to a ruffl	Tops
5583	Let the sun shine	Beautiful dress. the color in person in a rich golden sun, not too flashy. a very warm hue, it will compliment every skin tone. it is more fitted than most peasant dresses. not as much flowing material, very flattering. the slight beading on the yoke makes it a standout. very well made, with a nice cotton lining. i am usually a size six in a dress, and the small fit beautifully, even with my large top. it is a stunner, that can be worn with boots or sandals. you will receive a lot of compliments	Dresses
7620	Purchase immediately	I do not think i could express how much i love this top! it is so flattering and soft. i love that the bottom half is slightly sheer and a different fabric than the top. it is stretchy, which for me is a wonderful thing. i purchased the day it came in store. it is quickly prone to pilling though!! with the style of shirt it's not so bad, but kind of unfortunate for a top that is almost $100.

I love this jess. i got it in the blue gray color, and i think it's going to be great for spring and will work into summer as well. cloth and stone is always one of my favorite brands and this dress is so soft. i'm thinking that i'm going to belt it to give it some more shape but i like how it looks unbelted as well	Dresses

22995	Flimsy	Oh what a disappointment! i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan. the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam. so, back it goes. and, i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost $60 for this top!	Intimate
12635	Please make in more florals and patterns!	"This suit is perfect in every way! (the leg opening could be a little bigger for the size) i would be a small if the leg openings were a bit bigger.

please please offer another suit before december 2015 so i can buy for our cruise!!!"	Intimate
21621	Super long sleeves	This is a cute top but the sleeves are super long.  they swallowed up my entire hand when i put my arms down to the side.  i also found it to run slightly large.  i ordered my usual medium and i had too much room under the armpits.  the sleeves weren't as fitted as the model shot either, which i would of preferred.  i probably could of shortened the sleeves, but didn't think this style top fit me so i sent it back.  this does not require a cami underneath.	Tops
2895	Darling cardigan with beautiful detailing	This cardigan is beautiful with its cropped fit, flutter sleeves and vineyard detailing. i can see wearing this a lot this fall and winter. my only complaint is that the sweater was pilling/shedding quite a bit the first time that i wore it. i hope that that doesn't happen every time that i wear it. i also have yet to wash it to see how the fabric looks after washing.	Tops
18906	Adorable	Loved these beach pants! i purchased the size medium in the coral. i loved the accents on the ties and the little pom pom details. i did get many compliments on them. the only thing i don't love about them is the material is very thin. i know they are beach pants but i personally would have liked slightly more weight to them. i wore them once with a pair of cropped leggings underneath and i thought it was a very cute way to wear them with some additional substance underneath.	Intimate
1894	Great shirt	I first bought the red & green at the store. when they went on sale bought the blue & ivory. love, love ,love these shirts! they go great with a skirt or jeans. so happy i got them. the fabric is stretchy, but still fits very nicely. what a great buy, hope to see more of this style again.

23348	Sleeve	"I've been looking for a nice summer maxi dress and after reading some positive reviews, i decided to get the dress. the fabric is soft and has a nice flow to it. however, i had to return the dress because the cuff of the sleeve was too tight on my forearm, which make it impossible for me to raise my arms.

i ordered size petite xxs"	Dresses
3066		I couldn't agree more with that first review. i would add that it does run large.the leg holes are big. beautiful flower watercolor design as it shows in the picture. soft fabric and thin elastic waist band. no fake string tightener or buttons. simple and romantic. yet still a good sleep short to prance around the house in:)	Intimate

"Love this dress and its versatility! great design concept. fabric is pretty soft, cozy, and warm, as well. i found the dress to run large. i ordered a medium in the gray and small in the rose. i did like both colors irl, but the size small was the best fit. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 135 lbs, and wear a 6. the size small hit just above my knees and the sleeves reached down to my knuckles. i wore this around the house for awhile and realized that while the knit was nice and tight when i first put i"	Dresses
3060	Very comfortable and cute, too!	I love this top and bought it in both colors. what's really fun is that i found a pair of espadrille sandals to match the sandy beige and white colored top and i have attached a photo of me under my arbor to show you. these tops are designed to have a flattering fit. i ordered size small and they are not too tight. i am 36 c in the bust line and an hour glass figure on bottom. i love that they are off the shoulder a bit and in a v neck, which is flattering on me. the material is soft and of good	Tops
7317	Twisted and terrific for all cup sizes	Love this top! i was worried it would plunge too deep, especially because i'm quite flat chested - but it is perfect. i think it would look gorgeous on a volumptuous woman too. that's the beauty of it. and the color is my absolute favorite right now ... :)	Tops
3786	Shirt has slits!	"This is a cute shirt, but it has slits at the bottom of the hem so that the front bottom of the shirt has this small rectangular ""flap."" it's not visible from the photo. i think it'll have to be returned for this reason."	Tops
9099		If you look closely at the pictures this dress is shown 2 different ways. one with a lace covered v-neck and one with a rounded neck. which is it retailer? don't know about the size but i had to answer the question. i won't order the dress until i know exactly which style i'm ordering.

21561		"This top is beautiful and i have received so many compliments on it. the fit is very complimenting, and i would continue to wear it often except that the fabric is unraveling. the bottom of the lace has raw edges so i would expect some fraying there but my top is shedding long streaks of material with each wear throughout the entire top, 1-5"" strands of the lace unraveling isn't exactly a great look."

7546	Love this sweater!	"I'm glad i checked out the reviews before purchasing - i went a size smaller and the sweater fit perfectly! i love the taupe color - it's feminine (not overtly so) and i can still use it as a neutral. the quality is really quite good, though i would still suggest keeping metal accessories (without smooth edges) away from the fabric. it's also not too heavy so i can still wear this despite the heat and humidity in honolulu.

13087	Flattering and comfortable	I bought these in light grey and navy. they are both beautiful. high quality,very flattering, and so comfortable! i love them! they're a perfect long length. i have long legs and it can be challenging finding a good length in pants. the pockets are deep and functional, which is rare in women's pants. they are more than i like to spend, but i will get a lot of wear out of them. they look and feel fantastic. i highly recommend these!

4715	Triangles aren't my shape	So, i want to start off by saying, the quality of this shirt really was great. as was the pattern, unfortunately if you're going off the picture know that they definitely pinned in the sides on the model. this shirt has a full on triangle shape and flares significantly towards the bottom, it's not a straight fit as the picture would suggest. i'm sure this works for some women but if you're muscular with an already v-shape to your body (meaning your shoulders are significantly sized and you have	Tops
12663	Runs small would be a bit of an understatement...	It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women's apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small	Bottoms

9621	Excellent if you do not have a chest	I received this today and will have to send it back. it is super cute and the quality is great. however, you need to wear a bra or a halter bra due to the style which is not a proble, but my 32d chest looked huge in this top so it is going back.	Tops
18968	Interesting	"This dress is unusual. it can be dressed up with wedges and dressed down with cool sneakers. if you have any under arm excess fat it will show...but you can hide it with a cropped cardigan. i am 5' 1"", 105 pounds, lean athletic frame with a 32b bust and it fit well and snug.i bought an xxs. i am relatively lean under the under arm but this dress does show any flaw in this area and it does not look good. minus point. super cute and made well. i wear it with a cardigan."

7318	Comfy and beautiful	I bought this impulsively to wear to a wedding, and i&#39;m so glad i did. it is so soft and comfy and gorgeous--and has pockets. it&#39;s loose but really really flattering somehow. i would typically get a size 12 in a fitted dress but the medium was perfect for me.

12446		I bought the ivory sweater. lovely color and softness. the zipper is a great, unique feature that i love. the bottom has a wavy shape with extra fabric - definitely creates a bell shape.	Tops

11939	Love it!	Such a cute take on a henley/button down shirt! i first bought the green and blue version in my typical size medium and while it was bigger than i expected it to be i kept it because i liked the oversized/tunic look i got with some skinny jeans and boots. i decided to order this color in a small to get a different look. i'm just as pleased with the fit of the smaller size! i think this size will work better for tucking in and more tailored looks. yea! these shirts are so soft and made of substan	Tops

22714	Large and wide	This colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but from the chest to the hips there is too much fabric and it give you no shape at all. it had to go back.	Dresses

21395	Beautiful top	Loved the material and the feel. however, it does run a bit large on the shoulders so i had to return.	Tops
12526	Beautiful dress, fits horribly	"I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate, but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular, as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit, technically, but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short, but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3"", but it fe"	Dresses
54	Cute top	Nice top. armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman, i'm picky about that. the print is pretty and unusual. it just didn't look great on me. there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely. it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque. i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible. great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now, that i decided to return since summer is winding down. i do recommend.

10877	Love the fabric and colors, but...	"I bought the rose and the sapphire during the xtr 40% off clearance. i'm just under 5'4"", curvy & usually wear med petite in retailer dresses. i ordered a mr because, being sale items, only regular sizing was available. a sp would have been much better! the dress hit about 3"" below my knee and the crisscross top made my bust look matronly. a snugger fit would have been sexier. the rose was darker than pictured & pretty, but eh on me. however, the sapphire was gorgeous. i'm sad about returning it."	Dresses
23067	Cute, poorly made	Love the fit of this top, love the design. it does fit a bit small which was a pleasant surprise considering the sizes don't go as small as i usually have to. i got the smallest size and its pretty tight. its a revealing/low cut top, which is great for minimal tan lines. negative- threads are coming out all over after one wear. but i love it so much i will probably order again once it falls apart.. not so great considering the price though.

10259	You had me at hello	"I am very particular about jeans. it's not just the look; it;s the feel and the quality of the fabric that won me over. the mid-rise wide-leg crop is perfection. i'm 5'7"" and a size 8. these are extremely flattering and versatile to go casual or incorporate into a more professional feel. great way to show off some of the fabulous fall footwear options as well. i highly recommend."

13661	Tricky to wear	I am torn about this dress. the print is very pretty and the fabric has a gentle flow to it. the top part is great but the portion below the chest reminded me of a tent. it is tricky to pull off if you are well-endowed on the top or wear a padded bra. i liked the look better when i tied it at the back with the ultra-thin belt straps which gave some shape to the waist. i agree with the other reviewer that a slim person could carry the look well. i usually don't return online purchases unless they	Dresses

I love this color blue. when this item went on sale i had to grab it and i'm glad i did. it feels medium weight to me so i could throw this on, on a cool summer night and also in the fall. there is some sparkle to the fabric which i think is really a nice added touch. feels comfortable on and looks adorable.

2628	Cool top	Impecable workmanship (overseas). i usually wear a petite 2 but ordered this in a regular size 0 and glad that i did. since it curves up on this side, it barely overs the waistband on my jeans. ordered this in pink but it's more of pale coral pink. the style is more of a semi-halter sleeve but it have snaps on the inside shoulders to keep the bra straps from showing or you can wear a halter bra. it's a very light weight cotton and flowing and it will be great for the hot weather.

19241	Great look all in one	I love everything about this sweater. it is very well made, beautiful material and such an effortless way to pull it all together. it runs large which was unfortunate for me as i bought the xs petite and i really need xxs in this one, but none are left. i am 5 ft. tall and weigh about 96 pounds. i can wear a 0 but not in this sweater. it runs very well and i highly recommend it. hope they make more in this style. it is so fresh looking and so comfortable.

9126	And it has pockets!	This jacket is very well made. the denim is quality and very soft. the other fabric isn't as heavy as the denim, but not so much that it feels like a mismatch when wearing it. i was surprised to find slash pockets by the side seams. on the interior, the slash pockets are sewn down and deep so that you can use them as pockets too. handy for your phone. fits true to size maybe a tiny bit on the generous side like a jean jacket should be. love it.

12595	Runs a bit large	And hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous. i think how it fits depends alot on body type. the material is nice, color pretty, not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine.....	Tops

9699	Lovely!	This is such a cute and flattering top. it isn't a style i would normally gravitate to, but i liked the color so i thought i'd try it on. i ended up trying on the medium because they were out of my usual large and it fits great. it drapes really nicely and looks super cute with jeans and booties. the little stripe of ladder lace around the middle is a bit see thru but not revealing. it's a nice top for transitioning from summer to fall.

308	Too distressed	First i ordered a m. i'm normally a 8-10. the m was too small so i returned and ordered a lg. the lg fits great but there is a huge area of distressing on the shoulder that will turn into a hole. i love this jacket but cannot keep it in its condition. hopefully i will make it to the store soon (there are none w/in an hour of me) and look before i buy.

8916	Much more than a flannel shirt	I love the feel of this shirt. from a distance it looks like flannel but close up it appears more like muslin. i find the fabric very soft and the colors are fab--more vivid than the photo. the buttons do not go all the way up the shirt. for me the top button is right at the top of my cleavage so i can wear it alone or with a cami or other scoop neck. if you want a more refined flannel look/feel, this is it. i find it tts. if you're in between sizes, i would order down.

21853	Beautiful but short	Liked everything about this coat but the length! it is beautiful and good quality. first, ordered a medium because the fit seemed slight (i'm a 4-6), returned it for a large. unfortunately, the large will also be returned -- the body length is very cropped, not at all as it appears in photo to meet the top of a waistband. i'll hope to find a similar coat with just a bit more length.	Jackets
2207	The perfect long sleeve t-shirt	"This shirt is amazing! it's an excellent heavier weight quality t-shirt, but so comfortable. if you are looking for the perfect shirt to pair with your leggings and boots this fall/winter/spring, this is it! i am 5'8"" 136 lbs and this perfectly covers my rump and the small fit perfectly. the band around the wrist is a nice touch, making this a higher quality tee. i am buying more colors."	Tops
19775		"I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt, if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt ""wing out"" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff, felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect, the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size."	Bottoms
17681	Adorable one piece	Seafolly is my favorite brand in swimwear. i've collected a few over the years. i was so happy to find this print. the little umbrellas are so cute and fun. i am normally a size 8 in seafolly and this one ran true to size.	Intimate
2306	Great dress but cut too low	Dress caught my eye on the rack so i thought i'd try it on. the dress has lovely blue stripes (hard to discern in the online photo) which makes it a great year-round piece. however, like others have commented, it is too low to wear to work. will consider alternations to close the v-neck if the dress is marked down beyond its current sale price.	Dresses
12012	Comfortable and beautiful to boot	"I don't understand the low rating. the head opening in my size (2) is perfect and i don't have a small head. 
the style is both flattering on many shapes and very comfortable. the embroidery is gorgeous and the blue hue can be paired with many colors. it be worn with jeans on the weekend and also dresses up beautifully for the office if worn with a jacket and a pair of slacks. i wore it with an olive jacket and jeans last week and received compliments! 
the caveat is that it wrinkles.. a lot."	Tops
16616	Different fabric and looser cut	"I ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut. i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more ""denim"" version. the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser, less flattering fit. returned it and kept the regular ag stevie."	Bottoms
17120	Boxy and runs huge	I bought this shirt immediately because of the pattern, when it arrived i was super confused. it's not a tee shirt like it looks like in the photos. it's made with cotton fabric with a tiny bit of stretch. i ordered the xl because i have brought shoulders and 36e bras size and it fits like a 2x or larger. i would say order two sizes down. also it hangs like a maternity shirt. i might order it once it's on sale, which it definitely will be, but even then am not positive i would keep it.	Tops
22139	Too small	I usually wear a 6 and ordered two other skirts at the same time. the other skirts fit perfectly and this one was more like a size 2. very disappointed for i really liked the idea of it.	Bottoms
8745		This skirt is nicer in person. the fit is a little strange. the waist is tts but rest of the skirt runs a size large. i am a curvy size 8 and purchased the 6 based on another review. the waist is a tad snug but overall the skirt fits. it's too beautiful to return.	Bottoms
14971	Sweet basic tee	Great tee for layering, love the sweet lace along the bottom. the lace lines the entire body of the tee and it's a little thin so i prefer a cami underneath but a nude bra would be invisible. i usually wear a small, sometimes an xs, and the small fits like it does on the model.	Tops
13956	Lovely tee with great back detail	This top is really cute- the plum is a lovely color and the top fits true to size. love the back detailing. and it is really good t-shirt quality.	Tops
12970	Adorable top!	I rarely write reviews, but this one deserves one. this top is completely, utterly, adorable! it flows so beautifully, which makes it perfect to wear with leggings/skinny jeans. i wore mine with a blazer for a work holiday party, and i received so many compliments. this top makes you feel so feminine and pretty. i love the maeve brand, and this is certainly no exception! i'd love to get it in multiple colors!	Tops
12028	Very high waisted	"I am 5'2"" and got this in a 6p. i would say it fits tts (the top also has some give), but the waist is just a few inches away from being empire. i think the dress on the model is pulled down to de-emphasize this. even so, it is a very cute dress - plan to wear it with a navy velvet jacket for easter."	Dresses
12146	Nice fit.	This is a very slimming, well-made, nice fitting top-i just disliked the colors. they did not look good on me. otherwise this is a very nice piece!	Tops

22955	Delicate lace beautiful design	This is a beautifully made sweater. i bought this sweater in ivory yesterday; i wore it today and received many compliments. i think the sweater is adorable. it?s soft and warm; the neck is perfect, i like that it?s not as restrictive as a turtleneck. the long sleeves add character and help to make it interesting. i highly recommend it?i?m looking for a black one,	Tops
17808	Very poor quality	I ordered this top in white along with the meadow rue lace sleeve top. while they are the same price, they aren't even close in quality. this top is one of the sheerest tops that i have seen. the trim, pocket and the lace-up tie are made from sheer type material that was twisted and didn't lay right, and the tag sewn inside, was sewn with red thread and showed through, very visible. i don' t think it would hold up after many washes. i returned this one and ordered another color in the lace sleev	Tops
2330	Amazing vest	I fell in love with this vest  the minute i saw it on the hanger.  it runs true to size and the material is excellent quality .  it looks great with jeans and a tee and also something dressier. i wore it over a navy blue wide-leg jumpsuit, and it looked truly amazing!  i  received so many compliments!  i also purchased the lace tie up top that it is featured with and can't wait for that to come in.	Jackets
13118	Versatile & comfortable	Got several compliments on the dress the first time i wore it, and know it will work well for both the office, church and even a holiday party or two. i'm right on the line between petite & regular sizes, and could have gone w/a petite (probably medium) size instead as the dress is just a touch long with a deeper neckline for my frame. otherwise it fits well and the color is great, even if it's not quite the same as in the photo. overall, i'm satisfied with my purchase!	Dresses
9286	Soft but realllly hi-lo	"Love the fabric that c s uses--so very soft and pliable.  fit is tts with room for draping over figure flaws and great for layering while open.  but the high-low hem is far more extreme than the new ""action shots"" show.  i'm kind of over this trend but at the same time love this shirt dress.  i'm 5'3"" 140# 36d and tried on m but will order mp online because of length."	Dresses
10582	Perfection!	"I am a huge fan of ag stevie ankles and own at least a dozen pair. i am 5'4"", so this style is perfect for me. this particular wash is a fantastic and flattering fit. it hits right above my ankle and fits beautifully through the hips and legs. i am going to buy a 2nd pair as i know i will be wearing these all the time!"	Bottoms
13307	Great quality chambray top	Chambray top that is soft, but thick/heavy so it drapes well and is very flattering on. untucked, the top is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it hangs like a tunic, almost a-line so do not size up or you will have too much material. i am a sz small in most retailer clothing, and the sz 2 fit nicely. sz 4 was too loose around my arms, and the sz 0 was too tight around my chest. nice neckline and a pop of surprise with the gorgeous lace detail in the back.	Tops
13622		"I cannot say enough good things about this dress. as a petite person (5'0), it is so hard to find things that fit well without alterations, but this dress fit perfectly. it's also so well-made: the fabric is soft, comfortable, and gorgeously detailed, and the dress is lined which makes it feel durable and gives the skirt some volume (in a good, flattering way)! i got it shortened by about 2"", but this dress fits like a dream."	Dresses
21356	Cozy dress that's still chic	This dress is so cozy and soft. love it! the cowl is big in a flattering way. absolutely adore the buttons that run down the back of the dress. such an unexpected detail which makes retailer pieces so special. i would layer tights and tank underneath anyway so the see through aspect other reviewers mentioned wasn't apparent to me and also wasn't as big a deal.	Dresses
20462	Love the design, hate the itchiness!	My title perfectly describes my attitude toward this sweater. the print is super cute and the price point is great, but this sweater was so itchy that i couldn't even keep it on for longer than a minute. it may be okay with a long sleeve underneath, but don't even think about wearing it by itself!	Tops
11903	Just average	Online this top looks fabulous, but in person, not so great. great color, nice quality for a lightweight top, but when i tried it on, the neck does not lay nicely. too much sloppy wrinkled material just hanging awkwardly around the neck ( and i love cowl neck). i found, for me, it dipped very low showing cleavage and i have a large chest, so didn't work. for reference, i'm 5'4 118 and usually wear a small in retailer tops because it seems the majority of their clothes run large. i purchased a smal	Tops
1572	Too low cut	Gorgeous color and great price, but too low cut and because of the design, a cami's wouldn't work. disappointed	Tops
4691		This top really pays attention to detail. it is very refreshing to buy a top that is lined so i don;t need to struggle to find the right cami to go underneath. also there is a lovely snap fixture to hold your bra strap in place. very thoughtful :) the top seems to run true to size and fits well. neither the arm holes or the v-neck are too low. i agree with the first reviewer that the main need for sizing up or down is due to breast size. i'm a 36dd and the 10 fit perfectly. also, the colors in t	Tops
21753	Perfect fall casual top	I love this top. it's not just an average tee due to the asymmetry in the seams. it's super soft and comes in some great colors. i wish it was slightly longer on the sides but otherwise perfect tee!	Tops
