r30773	I love oddball animation, I love a lot of Asian films, but I didn't love this particular product of Japan. The Fuccons are supposedly an American family (they're all mannequins) who have moved to Japan, and they're somewhat a 50's sitcom type family, with slightly more modern sensibilities at times. The DVD features several very short episodes (like less than 5 minutes each?) and I did not find it to be either funny or entertaining, not even in a weird way. I'm not sure what the appeal is of this. I did pick up on some satire here and there, gosh, who wouldn't, but satire is usually somewhat humorous, isn't it? And nothing I saw or heard rated even a little smirk. I picked this up used and it certainly SOUNDED appealing, but I guess either I'm missing the point or it's just plain LAME. The box even says it's Fuccon hilarious, right there on the front, but I beg to differ. 2 out of 10.	i love oddball animation i love a lot of Asian film but i t love this particular duct of japan the are supposed an American family they re all mannequin who have moved to japan and they re somewhat a s sitcom type family with slight more modern sensibilities at time the DVD feature several very short episode like less than 5 minute each and i did not find it to be either funny or entertaining not even in a weird way i m not sure what the appeal i of this i did pick up on some satire here and there gosh who t but satire i usual somewhat humorous t it and nothing i saw or heard rated even a little smirk i pick this up used and it certain sound appealing but i guess either i m miss the point or it s just plain lame the box even say it s hilarious right there on the front but i beg to differ 2 out of	negative
r897	I managed to see this at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my boyfriend. We were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving. It was very well directed with strong imagery. The visual effects were amazing - especially for a short. It had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic: This film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father. There is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard. This leans towards the Gothic feel. I would love to see this as a full feature film. -- Carrie	i manage to see this at the new York international film festival in November with my boyfriend we were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotional moving it was very well direct with strong imagery the visual effect were amazing especial for a short it had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic this film i about a young girl who i visit by a demon offering to help h situation with h abusive father there i also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard this lean toward the Gothic feel i would love to see this a a full feature film Carrie	positive
r4241	"Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. Professor Noodle (Lucien Littlefield) is nearing the completion of his rejuvenation formula, with the ability to reverse ageing, after twenty years. Ollie and Stan are the chimney sweeps that arrive to do their job, and very quickly Ollie wants to get away from Stan making mistakes. Ollie goes to the roof to help with the other end of the brush at the top of the chimney, but Stan in the living room ends up pushing the him back in the attic. After breaking an extension, Stan gets a replacement, a loaded gun, from off the wall, and of course it fires the brush off. Stan goes up to have a look, and Ollie, standing on the attic door of the roof, falls into the greenhouse. Stan asks if he was hurt, and Ollie only answers with ""I have nothing to say."" Ollie gets back on the roof, and he and Stan end up in a tug and pull squabble which ends up in Ollie falling down and destroying the chimney. Ollie, hatless, in the fireplace is hit on the head by many bricks coming down, and the butler Jessup (Sam Adams) is covered in chimney ash smoke, oh, and Ollie still has nothing to say to Stan. The boys decide to clean up the mess, and when Stan tears the carpet with the shovel, Ollie asks ""Can't you do anything right"", and Stan replies ""I have nothing to say"", getting the shovel bashed on his head. As Ollie holds a bag for Stan to shovel in the ashes, they get distracted by a painting on the wall, and the ashes end up down Ollie's trousers, so Stan gets another shovel bashed on the head. Professor Noodle finishes his formula, and does a final test on a duck, with a drop in a tank of water, changing it into a duckling. He also shows the boys his success, turning the duckling into an egg, and he next proposes to use a human subject, i.e. his butler. While he's gone, the boys decide to test the formula for themselves, but Ollie ends up being knocked by Stan into the water tank with all the formula. In the end, what was once Ollie comes out, an ape, and when Stan asks him to speak, all Ollie ape says is ""I have nothing to say"", and Stan whimpers. Filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white film, it is an enjoyable film. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian.

r8368	"She's The Man was everything I wanted it to be and maybe even a little more. I love the teen type ""chick flick"" films and I knew this one would be great!! In the same vein as 10 Things I Hate About You (one of my all time faves) She's The Man is a unique, well written, very well performed comedy with some of the funniest lines, and physical comedy I have seen in a long time. It's probably the funniest movie I've seen this year (with the exception of the hilarious Pink Panther.) But She's The Man is actually a more intellectual funny and most of the humor relies on the witty script, ""Three's Company"" style story of mistaken identities, and mixed messages, and the cast.<br /><br />Amanda Bynes is a star!! Even since the days of the horribly campy (yet strangely entertaining ""The Amanda Show"", she has shown a brilliant talent for comedy. She's probably one of the most talented comediennes out there. Her style of physical comedy, impersonations, and witty dialect makes her hilarious. Previously her big screen debut (where she was the star) was the rather hilarious and well made ""What A Girl Wants."" If that wasn't her break out vehicle than She's The Man takes care of that hands down. Bynes is really the ultimate girl next door. It's a shame she doesn't do more big screen work because she could be the next ""It"" girl. She is the All American, cute, down to earth, bubbly teen (although she's twenty now) and whether or not she'll be able to carry her talent and style over to being an adult actor will remain to be seen. But for the purpose of this film she is perfect!! She actually legitimately pulls off the rather outlandish plot of her impersonating her twin brother and makes it believable. Not entirely...but believable enough. Most of the script relies on the comedy of her errors trying to be a guy but it's just hilarious, non stop laughs. Channing Tatum redeems himself from his deplorable performance in 2005's ""Havoc"" by plays Duke. He's the jock, the captain of the soccer team, and eventually Bynes' object of affection, unfortunately he's also Sebastian's room mate (who is Bynes.) He's a good leading man, and the chemistry is perfect between them. Laura Ramsey is Olivia, who happens to be attracted to Sebastian (who again is Bynes.) She does good as well although her part is small and she doesn't really effect the rest of the cast one way or another. James Kirk is great in his small role as the real Sebastian. His resemblance to Amanda Bynes is astonishing...they are absolutely believable as twins and further more, from a distance you could understand someone believing Bynes is Sebastian. The rest of the cast all fit in there somewhere and their roles range from brief to more supporting but essentially they are all supporting the story between Bynes and Tatum but everyone is more or less supporting Bynes terrific performance. She easily carries the film with no hesitations and makes it worth while.<br /><br />This is one of those films that shows so much in the trailer and yet it's not one of those films that when that part comes up it's not funny anymore. The parts in the trailer that make you laugh are even more hilarious in the actual film. Relative newcomer director Andy Fickman does such an incredible job on this film. He weaves together a potentially complicated storyline and makes it flow naturally and makes everything fall together. The story which is loosely based off of Shakespeares Twelfth Night but it's remarkable how much they managed to translate over to this modern day film. It's seemingly completely off the wall but more exact to the classic comedy than you'd think. There isn't too much to say about a downside except that the last half hour drags a little and also becomes a might predictable but it doesn't change the hilarity of the first half of the film. Nonetheless you'll be laughing to tears and it's one of the funniest films in the theater right now hands down!!! 9/10"	she s the man was everything i wanted it to be and maybe even a little more i love the teen type chick flick film and i knew this one would be great in the same vein a the i hate about you one of my all time fave she s the man i a unique well written very well performed comedy with some of the funny line and physical comedy i have seen in a long time it s probably the funny movie i seen this year with the exception of the hilarious pink panther but she s the man i actual a more intellectual funny and most of the humor rely on the witty script three s company style story of mistaken identity and mixed message and the cast Amanda i a star even since the day of the horribly campy yet strange entertaining the Amanda show she ha shown a brilliant talent for comedy she s probably one of the most talented comedienne out there h style of physical comedy impersonate and witty dialect make h hilarious previous h big screen debut where she was the star was the rather hilarious and well made what a girl want if that t h break out vehicle than she s the man take care of that hand down i real the ultimate girl next door it s a shame she t do more big screen work because she could be the next it girl she i the all American cute down to earth bubbly teen although she s twenty now and whether or not she ll be able to carry h talent and style over to being an adult actor will remain to be seen but for the purpose of this film she i perfect she actual legitimate pull off the rather outlandish plot of h impersonate h twin brother and make it believable not entire but believable enough most of the script rely on the comedy of h error trying to be a guy but it s just hilarious non stop laughs Tatum deem himself from hi deplore performance in s havoc by play duke he s the jock the captain of the soccer team and eventual object of affection fortunate he s also Sebastian s room mate who i he s a good leading man and the chemistry i perfect between them Laura Ramsey i Olivia who happen to be attract to Sebastian who again i she does good a well although h part i small and she t real effect the rest of the cast one way or another James Kirk i great in hi small role a the real Sebastian hi semblance to Amanda i astonishing they are absolute believable a twin and further more from a distance you could understand someone believing i Sebastian the rest of the cast all fit in there somewhere and their role range from brief to more support but essentially they are all support the story between and Tatum but everyone i more or less support terrific performance she easily carry the film with no hesitate and make it worth while this i one of those film that show so much in the trailer and yet it s not one of those film that when that part come up it s not funny anymore the part in the trailer that make you laugh are even more hilarious in the actual film relative newcomer director Andy does such an credible job on this film he weave together a potential complicated and make it flow natural and make everything fall together the story which i loosely base off of twelfth night but it s remark how much they manage to translate over to this modern day film it s seeming complete off the wall but more exact to the classic comedy than you d think there t too much to say about a downside except that the last half hour drag a little and also become a might predictable but it t change the hilarity of the first half of the film nonetheless you ll be laughing to tear and it s one of the funny film in the theater right now hand down 9	positive

r25713	"If you know anything about the Manhattan Project, you will find ""Fat Man and Little Boy"" at least an interesting depiction of the events surrounding that story. The film is in all ways a very realistic portrayal of these events, and in many ways it is almost too real (such as some scenes involving radiation poisoning). Paul Newman, as usual, is brilliant in his role and always manages to come off like a real person on the screen. The supporting cast, such as John Cusack, Laura Dern, Bonnie Bedelia, and Natasha Richardson, is fairly good as well. This film is not, however, one of the best examples of turning a true story into a movie. Great films are able to take a true story and use just enough artistic license to keep its audience engaged for the entire movie. This one, however, tends to drag a bit throughout, and some scenes (such as John Cusack and Natasha Richardson's love story) could have been eliminated entirely without causing the film to lose much. Nevertheless, there are enough interesting facts and tiny humorous bits to at least keep the audience interested enough to see the entire film. It does not always entertain, but as far as great depictions go, this is very accurate, fascinating, and will leave the audience with something to think about.<br /><br />*** out of ****"	if you know anything about the Manhattan project you will find fat man and little boy at least an interesting depiction of the event surrounding that story the film i in all way a very realistic portrayal of these event and in many way it i almost too real such a some scene involve radiation poisoning Paul Newman a usual i brilliant in hi role and always manage to come off like a real person on the screen the support cast such a john Laura Bonnie and Natasha Richardson i fair good a well this film i not however one of the best example of turning a true story to a movie great film are able to take a true story and use just enough artistic license to keep it audience engage for the entire movie this one however tend to drag a bit throughout and some scene such a john and Natasha Richardson s love story could have been eliminate entire without cause the film to lose much nevertheless there are enough interesting fact and tiny humorous bit to at least keep the audience interested enough to see the entire film it does not always entertain but a far a great depiction go this i very accurate fascinating and will leave the audience with something to think about out of	positive
r44867	When I was 17 my high school staged Bye Bye Birdie - which is no great surprise, since it is perfect high school material and reputed to be the most-staged musical in the world.<br /><br />I was a music student and retained strong memories of the production and its songs, as well as a lingering disregard for the Dick Van Dyke movie version which had (deliberately) obscured the Elvis references and camped it up for a swinging 60s audience.<br /><br />So, when the 1995 version starring Jason Alexander hit my cable TV screen, I was delighted with what I saw. Alexander turns in an exceptional performance as Albert, a performance in strong contrast to his better-known persona from a certain TV series. The remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles (Chynna Phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part, supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirl).<br /><br />But best of all, the musical numbers familiar from the stage show are all preserved in this movie and performed as stage musical songs should be (allowing for the absence of a stage).<br /><br />So, if you know the musical (and few do not), then check out this telemovie. It does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be bettered, which is good enough for me. What is better than rendering a writer's work faithfully and with colour and style?	when i was my high school stag bye bye birdie which i no great surprise since it i perfect high school material and reputed to be the most stag musical in the world i was a music student and retain strong memory of the production and it song a well a a lingering regard for the dick van dyke movie version which had deliberate obscure the Elvis reference and camp it up for a swing audience so when the version starring Jason Alexander hit my cable TV screen i was delighted with what i saw Alexander turn in an exceptional performance a Albert a performance in strong contrast to hi better known persona from a certain TV series the remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their role Phillips i perhaps the on one who does not look h part supposed a naive and innocent schoolgirl but best of all the musical number familiar from the stage show are all preserve in this movie and performed a stage musical song should be allow for the absence of a stage so if you know the musical and few do not then check out this it does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be better which i good enough for me what i better than rendering a writer s work faithful and with and style	positive
r44093	"""Opening Night"" released in 1977, tries to be an ambitious production. It succeeds only in the truly stunning performance of Gena Rowlands. Her character of theatre actress Myrtle is not necessarily someone we would love in real life. She is self-absorbed, often obnoxious, and makes life miserable for those around her - in other words, not unlike some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman on the edge of collapse - we are not quite sure if the demons she is fighting are real or imagined, although we are let in on the secret early. Rowlands is obviously well directed with love by her gifted husband, actor/director John Cassavettes, who has a role in the film as well. This film is not without flaws - it is overly long, and the last part of the film where Myrtle goes on stage while very drunk seems almost cruel. The ""improvising"" in some of the dialogue - at least while on stage - goes on way too long. Some of the supporting characters give good performances, especially from Ben Gazarra, playing Myrtle's sleazy producer. Joan Blondell's character is never fully developed, and I never could figure out why she was in the film, except to placate Myrtle. See this film for Rowlands alone - she is fascinating throughout - and it is tough to take your eyes off her, although you will want to at times."	opening night released in try to be an ambitious production it succeed on in the truly stunning performance of Gena h character of actress myrtle i not necessarily someone we would love in real life she i self absorb often obnoxious and make life miser for those around h in other word not unlike some actress myrtle i also a woman on the edge of collapse we are not quite sure if the demon she i fighting are real or imagine although we are let in on the secret early i obvious well direct with love by h gift husband actor director john who ha a role in the film a well this film i not without flaw it i overly long and the last part of the film where myrtle goes on stage while very drunk seem almost cruel the improvise in some of the dialogue at least while on stage goes on way too long some of the support character give good performance especial from Ben play myrtle s sleazy producer Joan s character i never fully developed and i never could figure out why she was in the film except to placate myrtle see this film for alone she i fascinating throughout and it i tough to take your eye off h although you will want to at time	positive

Besides in the film appear other historic personages as Camille Desmoulins(Patrice Chereau,now a famed filmmaker)Louis David,Saint Just(Jacobino),Tallien..<br /><br />The picture especially narrates the happenings surrounding the facing off of the principal figures,one-time partner revolution ,and posterior execution,although gives results a contemporary parable about the modern Poland,thus Danton is Lech Walesa and Robespierre is Wojciech Jaruzelski who was the Prime Minister imposed the martial law in Poland and with similar name than actor played Robespierre .

r14297	"Definitely not a film to revolutionize the industry or introduce any new techniques of film-making, this is a very handsome and solid production. It's miraculous that we can today enjoy it in superb quality on DVD - probably most of the viewers about a 100 years ago saw a black and white copy, as the stencil tinted de luxe edition was available only at the very best theaters. Even if you are not fascinated by this film or the subject of it, you can't but marvel at the copy released by Image Entertainment (together with another gem, From the Manger To the Cross, 1912). It's virtually impossible to see a film that is over a century old but shows so little damage. The process of stencil colouring was a very effective one and, compared to the occasionally blurry and smeared images of hand coloured film, the colours are crisp and well defined. Filmed within the limitations of the film-making as known back in 1902 when the filming commenced, the static nature of the scenes can today be considered almost intentional, meditative and solemn. The tableaux keep moving at a steady paste, so the film never gets tedious. You might not be fascinated by this film as a work of cinematography, but it sure is handsome as a work of academic, picturesque art. If you are a religious person, the fact that you are watching anonymous, long since departed people playing long since departed characters, adds to the mystery significantly. A proper viewing for Christmas or Lent. <br /><br />P.S: I've ticked the ""contains spoilers"" box just for fun.

r4101	For all the viewers who have seen 'The Cure' would agree with me on this comment that it is a superb movie and is very heartwarming. Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro prove their star quality in this movie, along with Dexter's (Mazzello) mother Annabella Sciorra.<br /><br />When i first watched The Cure on TV, i didn't know what to expect, but as i watched this masterpiece it soon became clear what it was about. Dexter an 11 year old boy who is plagued with AIDS, sits around his backyard playing with his toys when one day he meets his next door neighbour Eric, which at first is a little awkward for the 2 boys, but they soon became good friends.<br /><br />During the film, i kept wondering what would happen to the two boys, as they kept me wondering. I wondered how the heck they would get to New Orleans sitting a door with a sea biscuit under it pulling an inflatable crocodile behind it. There were other great scenes throughout the movie.<br /><br />But the part that reached out to me was the part when Dexter's health started to deteriorate. You just couldn't help but wonder if he was going to make it but towards the end you find out. I thought at the first prank they played, that Dexter was really dead he obviously wasn't, silly me. But when they play the third, something is very wrong. Dexter doesn't get up to laugh nor does he show any kind of laughter. At that point the victim of their prank soon announces that poor Dexter had died. At that part i lost it. I balled my eyes out, and from that scene onwards i was crying. You just have to. As the end nears you start to understand Eric's loss and then the movie ends on a nice note with Dexters shoe floating ever so slowly down the river.<br /><br />Overall this movie was excellent. It has laughter, adventure, emotion and sadness etc. When you put that in a blender you get an excellent, must watch film. Peter Horton has done a great job directing this film and i believe its certainly one of his best. But for now, i will try to search for this movie on DVD, if it exists that is.

As a ""for instance"", Marion's costuming looked suspiciously like it came from Walmart. And Sir Guy, well, he looked a bit like a character from an outer space movie! RoS has stolen the spotlight, probably forever, in the telling of this tale. Cast, costuming, story lines, scenery, filming and soundtrack by Clannad are all superb, as is evidenced by all the continual feedback some 26 years on. RoS is a timeless classic. My thanks to all who made the series."	by mistake i ordered a series from the BBC their new version of robin hood very disappointing in comparison with terrible costume and background while i enjoy the sheriff who took cue from the nick grace character the rest of the cast left much to be desired a a for instance Marion s costume look suspicious like it came from Walmart and sir guy well he look a bit like a character from an out space movie ha stolen the spotlight probably forever in the telling of this tale cast costume story line scenery film and soundtrack by are all superb a i evidence by all the continual feedback some year on i a timeless classic my thank to all who made the series	positive
r24028	<br /><br />***************************MILD SPOILERS AHEAD**************************<br /><br />We Dive at Dawn is an English made movie with John Mills in the lead role. The second time I watched the DVD version was on a big screen TV and I must say the movie is better than I thought the first time I saw it on the samll screen. May be it was the big screen viewing that helped?<br /><br />I still say the first few segments of the movie are muddled, but once the submarine leaves the dock and begins its mission, the movie takes off too! The search for the German battleship named the Brandenburg and the adventures which went along with it were absorbing and the detail shown in the movie are interesting!<br /><br />I'm increasing my rating to 7/10. If you enjoy WW II films, I think you'll find this one interesting once the submarine gets underway. Some of the men on the sub have quite a sense of humor, too!	mild spoil ahead we dive at dawn i an English made movie with john mill in the lead role the second time i watch the DVD version was on a big screen TV and i must say the movie i better than i thought the first time i saw it on the screen may be it was the big screen viewing that help i still say the first few segment of the movie are muddle but once the submarine leave the dock and begin it mission the movie take off too the search for the German battleship named the Brandenburg and the adventure which went along with it were absorbing and the tail shown in the movie are interesting i m increasing my rating to 7 if you enjoy WW ii film i think you ll find this one interesting once the submarine get underway some of the men on the sub have quite a sense of humor too	positive
r46617	"The best thing from the American Pie ""bakery."" I found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the American Pie movies to date. .Also concerning the appropriateness of the content I found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie first came out I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...I now regret that decision. The movie far exceeded my expectations in terms of plot, dialog/scripting, and overall quality. I give it two thumbs way up!"	the best thing from the American pie bakery i found the humor and the plot to be far more engage audience than any of the American pie movie to date also concerning the appropriateness of the content i found this to be accept to a much large audience than any of the previous American pie movie i thorough enjoy this movie experience when the movie first came out i read a number of negative view and end up not going to see it while it was still in the theater i now regret that decision the movie far exceed my expectation in term of plot dialog script and overall quality i give it two thumb way up	positive
r45763	I am a lover of B movies, give me a genetically mutated bat and I am in heaven. These movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world. Even a stupid B movie will usually make me laugh and I will still consider it a good thing. Then there was Hammerhead, which was so awful I had to register with IMDb so I could warn others. First there was the science of creating the shark-man, which the movie barely touched on. In order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes. During one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a stagehand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead (what fabulous special effects). Back to the science, I thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and the testing equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue. Anyway this movie had poor plot development, terrible story, and I'm sorry to say pretty bad acting. Not even William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs could save this stinker.	i am a lover of b movie give me a genetically mutate bat and i am in heaven these movie are good for making you stop think of everything else going on in your world even a stupid b movie will usual make me laugh and i will still consider it a good thing then there was hammerhead which was so awful i had to register with so i could warn other first there was the science of create the shark man which the movie bare touched on in order to keep the view interested they just made sure there was blood every few minute during one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparent a bucket of blood being thrown by a stagehand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead what fabulous special effect back to the science i thought it was very interesting that the female test subject were held naked and the test equipment require that they be monitor through their breast tissue anyway this movie had poor plot development terrible story and i m sorry to say pretty bad acting not even William hunter or Jeffrey comb could save this stinker	negative
r10101	"A sequel to (actually a remake of) Disney's 1996 live-action remake of 101 Dalmations. Cruella deVil (Glenn Close) is released from prison after being ""cured"" of her obsession with fur by a psychologist named Dr. Pavlov (ugh!). But the ""cure"" is broken when Cruella hears the toll of Big Ben, and she once again goes on a mad quest to make herself the perfect coat out of dalmation hides.<br /><br />This movie is bad on so many levels, starting with the fact that it's a ""Thanksgiving family schlock"" movie designed to suck every last available dime out of the Disney marketing machine. Glenn Close over-over-over-over-acts as Cruella. With all that she had to put up with in this movie -- the lame script, the endless makeup, getting baked in a cake at the end -- I hope they gave her an extremely-large paycheck.<br /><br />(Speaking of which, where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory, a bakery with a Rube Goldberg assembly line, and a candlelight restaurant all located within the same building -- as you do in the climax of this film?) Of course, the real stars of the movie are supposed to be the dogs. They serve as the ""Macaulay Culkin's"" of this movie, pulling all the stupid ""Home Alone"" gags on the villains. (Biting them in the crotch, running over their hands with luggage carts, squirting them with icing, etc., etc., etc., ad nauseum.) I have to admit, the dogs were fairly good actors -- much better than the humans.<br /><br />Gerard Depardieu is completely wasted in this movie as a freaked-out French furrier. The two human ""dog lovers"" -- rehashed from the earlier film, but with different actors -- are completely boring. When they have a spaghetti dinner at an Italian restaurant, the movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers, and their dogs at home, watching the dinner scene from ""Lady and the Tramp."" I thought to myself, ""Oh please, don't go there!"" I half-expected the humans to do a satire on the ""Lady and the Tramp"" dinner scene -- as Charlie Sheen did in ""Hot Shots: Part Deux"" -- doing the ""spaghetti strand kiss,"" pushing the meatball with his nose, etc.<br /><br />And don't get me started on the annoying parrot with Eric Idle's voice.<br /><br />The costumes were nominated for an Oscar, and the costumes in the movie *are* good. But they are the only good thing in the movie. The rest of it is unbearable dreck."	a sequel to actual a make of Disney s live action make of Glenn close i released from prison aft being cured of h obsession with fur by a psychologist named Dr Pavlov ugh but the cure i broken when hear the toll of big Ben and she once again goes on a mad quest to make herself the perfect coat out of hide this movie i bad on so many level start with the fact that it s a thanksgiving family schlock movie sign to suck every last available dime out of the Disney marketing machine Glenn close over over over over act a with all that she had to put up with in this movie the lame script the endless makeup getting baked in a cake at the end i hope they gave h an extreme large paycheck speak of which where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory a bakery with a rube Goldberg assembly line and a candlelight restaurant all locate within the same building a you do in the climax of this film of course the real star of the movie are supposed to be the dog they serve a the Macaulay s of this movie pull all the stupid home alone gag on the villain biting them in the crotch running over their hand with luggage cart squirt them with icing etc etc etc ad i have to admit the dog were fair good actor much better than the human Gerard i complete waste in this movie a a freak out french furrier the two human dog love hash from the early film but with different actor are complete boring when they have a spaghetti dinner at an Italian restaurant the movie cut back and for between the two love and their dog at home watch the dinner scene from lady and the tramp i thought to myself oh please don t go there i half expect the human to do a satire on the lady and the tramp dinner scene a charlie sheen did in hot shot part doing the spaghetti strand kiss push the meatball with hi nose etc and don t get me start on the annoying parrot with Eric idle s voice the costume were nominate for an Oscar and the costume in the movie are good but they are the on good thing in the movie the rest of it i bearable	negative
r12992	"I rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting but to my Horror this movie was the worst movie I had ever seen! I read the comment from Gumby-8 and he has to be a part of the cast or the crew. Unless Gumby-8 is a 4 year old child or some demented cult member no one in their right mind would think that this movie had any potential at all.<br /><br />I couldn't believe Gumby-8's comments. <br /><br />Quoting: ""From the ""Dune"" inspired opening animation to the quick pace...this film keeps the eye moving and works so well that repeat viewing is not unexpected.""<br /><br />The Animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact of that the film keeps the eye moving, well that's because you keep looking for any type of suspense. I mean give me a break Halloween was shot with a budget of $100,000.00 and a painted mask and also by the way became a cult classic. As far as ""repeat viewing is not unexpected"" I think he made a typo.<br /><br />Another quote from Gumby-8 the only Fan: ""The acting is also a strong aspect of the film.""<br /><br />With all due respect for the actors, their performance is nothing more than the respective talent of Robert Napton.<br /><br />The catchy Tagline: ""Beware the hour between dusk and darkness""<br /><br />That's because there is no dusk or darkness in this movie.<br /><br />MPAA rating ""Rated R for some violence/gore""<br /><br />The only gore you see is some red paint on a sheet over a dead body you never see. As far as I know it might be a clump of grass.<br /><br />In summation, I have seen horror flicks from the 50's, 60's and 70's. I have seen what I thought to be the absolutely worst and some that were very good. The director of this film either did not make any attempt, was asleep, or took a hit of acid. Whatever the case I think the actors deserve applause for trying to salvage a very poor job of direction. I would give this film a rating of .5 for a 'B' movie."	i rent this movie because it sound pretty interesting but to my horror this movie was the worst movie i had ever seen i read the comment from 8 and he ha to be a part of the cast or the crew unless 8 i a 4 year old child or some demented cult member no one in their right mind would think that this movie had any potential at all i t believe 8 s comment quote from the dune inspired opening animation to the quick pace this film keep the eye moving and works so well that repeat viewing i not unexpected the animation i the on aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact of that the film keep the eye moving well that s because you keep look for any type of suspense i mean give me a break Halloween was shot with a budget of and a painted mask and also by the way became a cult classic a far a repeat viewing i not unexpected i think he made a typo another quote from 8 the on fan the acting i also a strong aspect of the film with all due respect for the actor their performance i nothing more than the respective talent of Robert the catchy tagline beware the hour between dusk and darkness that s because there i no dusk or darkness in this movie rating rated r for some violence gore the on gore you see i some red paint on a sheet over a dead body you never see a far a i know it might be a clump of grass in summation i have seen horror flick from the s s and s i have seen what i thought to be the absolute worst and some that were very good the director of this film either did not make any attempt was asleep or took a hit of acid whatever the case i think the actor serve applause for trying to salvage a very poor job of direction i would give this film a rating of 5 for a b movie	negative
