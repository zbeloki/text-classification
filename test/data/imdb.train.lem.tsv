Do not waste your time on this film, even if you find yourself suffering from insomnia, as I did.

r14870	"There are so many stupid moments in 'Tower of Death'/'Game of Death 2' that you really wonder if it's a spoof. At times, it felt like I was watching a sequel to Kung Pow rather than a Bruce Lee film.<br /><br />To be honest, this film has bugger all to do with 'Game of Death'. If anything, it's more a sequel/remake of 'Enter the Dragon', incorporating many elements of that film - particularly the actual footage. Bruce Lee's character Billy Lo (apparently) investigates the sudden death of his friend and encounters a piece of film that was left with the man's daughter. When the body is stolen during the funeral (!), Billy is also killed and it's up to his wayward brother to avenge both men's deaths.<br /><br />Tong Long stars as brother Bobby Lo and doesn't really have the sort of charisma to carry the film. His fighting abilities are very good however. Bruce Lee obviously turns up thanks to (no longer) deleted footage simply to cash-in on the legacy. Saying that, on the whole, the footage is actually edited-in better than in 'Game of Death' but it doesn't stop the film from being a mess.<br /><br />OK, so the fights are actually very entertaining (dare I say mind-blowing) and make the film at least watchable. But there are so many daft elements to this film that it really tests your patience. First off, there's the supposed villain who lives on his palatial estate... or is that mental institution? Seriously, the nutter eats raw venison, drinks deer's blood, carries a monkey on his shoulder and owns some peacocks and lions (?!). This attempt to make him look tough and intelligent just makes you feel sorry for him - you half expect someone to escort him back to his room.<br /><br />In fact, this middle section is awful and when the scene involving a naked hooker and a lion suit arrived I turned it off. However, I did finish the film and was kind of glad I did because the fight scene towards the end (much like 'GOD') was the whole reason for watching. While the story is an embarrassment, the action is very good and contains excellent choreography.<br /><br />But even the finale disappoints if the premise was anything to go by. What we were told was that the 'Tower of Death' was a pagoda that was upside down and underground. This sounded great, like a twist on Bruce Lee's original idea with different styles of fighting on each level. Could this be the 'Game of Death' that was originally planned? No! The film should have been named ""Generator Room of Death"" because thats as far as the tower goes. Of yes, there were indeed one or two 'different' styles... there were foil clad grunts, leopard-skinned henchman and stupid monk. It's as though Enter the Dragon had never been made, with the plot being a poor imitation.<br /><br />Worth watching once for the fast paced fight scenes, but so stupid sometimes that it hurts. If this was intended, then fine. Thumbs up, however, for recreating that projector room scene from 'Enter The Dragon'."	there are so many stupid moment in tower of death game of death 2 that you real wonder if it s a spoof at time it felt like i was watch a sequel to pow rather than a Bruce lee film to be honest this film ha bugger all to do with game of death if anything it s more a sequel make of enter the dragon incorporate many element of that film particular the actual footage Bruce lee s character billy lo apparent investigate the sudden death of hi friend and encounter a piece of film that was left with the man s daughter when the body i stolen during the funeral billy i also kill and it s up to hi wayward brother to avenge both men s deaths tong long star a brother bobby lo and t real have the sort of charisma to carry the film hi fighting ability are very good however Bruce lee obvious turn up thank to no longer delete footage simply to cash in on the legacy saying that on the whole the footage i actual edited in better than in game of death but it t stop the film from being a mess OK so the fight are actual very entertaining dare i say mind blow and make the film at least watchable but there are so many daft element to this film that it real test your patience first off there s the supposed villain who live on hi palatial estate or i that mental institution serious the nutter eat raw venison drink deer s blood carry a monkey on hi shoulder and own some peacock and lion this attempt to make him look tough and intelligent just make you feel sorry for him you half expect someone to escort him back to hi room in fact this middle section i awful and when the scene involve a naked hooker and a lion suit arrive i turn it off however i did finish the film and was kind of glad i did because the fight scene toward the end much like god was the whole reason for watch while the story i an embarrassment the action i very good and contain excellent choreography but even the finale appoint if the premise was anything to go by what we were told was that the tower of death was a pagoda that was upside down and underground this sound great like a twist on Bruce lee s original idea with different style of fighting on each level could this be the game of death that was original planned no the film should have been named generator room of death because a far a the tower goes of yes there were indeed one or two different style there were foil clad grunt leopard skinned henchman and stupid monk it s a though enter the dragon had never been made with the plot being a poor imitation worth watch once for the fast pace fight scene but so stupid sometime that it hurt if this was intended then fine thumb up however for create that projector room scene from enter the dragon	negative
r39433	"Here's the good news first. ""Spirit"" is the most visually incredible animated film in current home theater release. The artwork and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend that you give this movie a look by virtue of the visuals alone.<br /><br />And now for the bad news. I really mean it when I say that the animation is the only thing this movie has going for it. You may remember that ""Spirit"" got badly trounced by ""Lilo and Stitch"" last summer. The first person who argues that it was because Disney is more well-established and had better advertising can write me a four page long essay entitled ""Why 'Lilo and Stitch''s Script Didn't Stink"".<br /><br />For all the incredible new animation technology on display in ""Spirit"", the story is almost *astonishingly* dull. There is a lesson here, and (needless to say) it doesn't just apply to animated movies. You can have the most mind-blowing visual effects ever to grace the eyes of a mortal, but if your story is boring and, more importantly, we don't care about your characters, it's bad film-making. Simple as that. The animation is still mind-blowing; I just can't wait to see what somebody with more imagination does with it."	here s the good news first spirit i the most visual credible animated film in current home theater release the artwork and effect are revolutionary and i commend that you give this movie a look by virtue of the visual alone and now for the bad news i real mean it when i say that the animation i the on thing this movie ha going for it you may remember that spirit got bad trounce by lilo and stitch last summer the first person who argue that it was because Disney i more well establish and had better advertising can write me a four page long essay entitle why lilo and stitch s script t stink for all the credible new animation technology on play in spirit the story i almost astonishing dull there i a lesson here and needless to say it t just apply to animated movie you can have the most mind blow visual effect ever to grace the eye of a mortal but if your story i boring and more important we don t care about your character it s bad film making simple a that the animation i still mind blow i just can t wait to see what somebody with more imagination does with it	negative
r39707	I was into the movie right away. I've seen the other Coen movies, with the exception of Raising Arizona, and I've noticed that each of their movies has a color. Fargo is gray/white, Lebowski is bright orange, and this movie is a pleasant yellow.<br /><br />The bright pleasant qualities of this movie start right away. Soon the look is accompanied by the great, great music. It's the old folk sound, the kind of music that was written during a time when music was enjoyed as a part of day to day life. Enjoyed by everyone, chain-gangs, church choirs, and even prison escapees.<br /><br />Now, about the prison escapees. I don't know what crime their characters could have possibly committed, as they are a very very friendly group of guys. Clooney is fantastic, completely nailing his role.<br /><br />Go see this as soon as possible. I believe that it can be enjoyed by anyone at some level. For some reason, the theater I was in was full of old ladies and old men, and they loved it.<br /><br />You'll love it too, I promise. I was compelled to get my hands on the soundtrack right away.	i was to the movie right away i seen the other movie with the exception of raise Arizona and i noticed that each of their movie ha a color Fargo i gray white i bright orange and this movie i a pleasant yellow the bright pleasant quality of this movie start right away soon the look i accompanied by the great great music it s the old folk sound the kind of music that was written during a time when music was enjoy a a part of day to day life enjoy by everyone chain gang church choir and even prison escapee now about the prison escapee i don t know what crime their character could have possibly committed a they are a very very friendly group of guy i fantastic complete nail hi role go see this a soon a possible i believe that it can be enjoy by anyone at some level for some reason the theater i was in was full of old lady and old men and they loved it you ll love it too i promise i was compelled to get my hand on the soundtrack right away	positive
r45597	I don't know why some guys from US, Georgia or even from Bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they don't understand at all. For those who did not watch this movie - watch it. Don't expect too much or don't put some frameworks just because this is Kosturica. Watch the movie without prejudice, try to understand the whole humor inside - people of Serbia DID actually getting married while Bil Clinton bomb their villages, gypsies in all Balkans are ALWAYS try to f*ck you up in any way they can, LOVE is always unexpected, pure and colorful, and Balkans are extremely creative. For those who claims this is a bad movie I can see only that the American's sh*t (like Meet Dave, Get Smart etc) are much much worse than a pure, frank Balkan humoristic love story movie as Promise me. The comment should be useful and on second place should represent the personal view of the writer. I think the movie is great and people watch it must give their respects to the director and story told inside. It is simple, but true. It is brutal, but gentle and makes you laugh to dead.	i don t know why some guy from US Georgia or even from Bulgaria have the courage to express feel about something they don t understand at all for those who did not watch this movie watch it don t expect too much or don t put some framework just because this i watch the movie without prejudice try to understand the whole humor inside people of Serbia did actual getting married while Clinton bomb their village gypsy in all Balkans are always try to f ck you up in any way they can love i always unexpected pure and colorful and Balkans are extreme creative for those who claim this i a bad movie i can see on that the American s sh t like meet Dave get smart etc are much much worse than a pure frank Balkan love story movie a promise me the comment should be useful and on second place should represent the personal view of the writer i think the movie i great and people watch it must give their respect to the director and story told inside it i simple but true it i brutal but gentle and make you laugh to dead	positive
r3444	Don't understand how these animated movies keep coming out, and no matter how good (or bad) it is people love it.<br /><br />I saw this movie with my two kids (5,7). They like pretty much anything animated (like most people who rated this film). The theater was almost full, and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast. To tell the truth I was bored silly. It was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny. There were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it. Of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh, but just didn't work. My son almost always says to me that he wants the DVD after we see an animated movie, but not on this one. My daughter fell asleep half way through. Also, the kids thought the character animation looked weird. I haven't heard that from them since seeing The Polar Express, which gave my daughter nightmares.<br /><br />Trust me, I'm not the type who looks for the negative in everything. But quality is quality, and like so many animated movies they throw out there, it has very little.	don t understand how these animated movie keep coming out and no matter how good or bad it i people love it i saw this movie with my two kid 5 7 they like pretty much anything animated like most people who rated this film the theater was almost full and i look forward to seeing the movie with it superb cast to tell the truth i was bore silly it was believably predictable and just plain unfunny there were a couple chuckle throughout the film and that was it of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh but just t work my son almost always say to me that he want the DVD aft we see an animated movie but not on this one my daughter fell asleep half way through also the kid thought the character animation look weird i haven t heard that from them since seeing the polar express which gave my daughter nightmare trust me i m not the type who look for the negative in everything but quality i quality and like so many animated movie they throw out there it ha very little	negative
r6643	"With its companion piece MASTERS OF HORROR, NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES can only be seen as the absolute nadir of the genre that began so auspiciously with THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE OUTER LIMITS.<br /><br />Of course, part of the problem is that it does nothing to be of any interest to a comparatively adult audience, instead aiming at TEN-YEAR-OLDS, who are only able to count body-bags, and scarcely that. And so grossness is king, and King is grossness.<br /><br />Stephen King is simply illiterate  in general he has the aptitude for storytelling of Bart Simpson. Since he cannot read his sole inspiration is the movies.<br /><br />True, the cinema is not such a bad place to start, since it has generally escaped the onslaught of ""Realism"". But these films are only the rumor, not the thing, and if you want to WRITE, you have to dig deeper.<br /><br />Of course, only PICKMAN had monsters as close acquaintances. But even so, it should be clear to any undergraduate that vampires are not Dracula and Lugosi.<br /><br />At least AUTOPSY ROOM FOUR is a clear indication of what is wrong. One can almost imagine this pathetic dolt sitting as his desk trying to come up with something SCARY.<br /><br />Not, mind you, trying to describe accurately the horror of the system of which he is an integral part, making the stupid stupider, but trying to come up with a scary story for his little nephew. Suppose, you were paralyzed, and people thought you were dead and started to cut you open like they do at those autopsy things! Wouldn't that be gross? And that, boys and girls, is the story.<br /><br />What about characterization? Oh yes, he's one of these suits, who never really appreciated life, you know, and now it's too late, right? And he's shouting  well, they can't actually hear him, you know  he's saying that he's going to sue the hospital, but he's not such a big shot anymore, you see, lying there (or is it laying, I can never remember) and all. And he's thinking: Oh no please, please don't cut me and this is terrible, lying (or laying) like that  now, wouldn't that be a great story? You know I read somewhere that a snake bite can do that, I think it was that great medical authority Agatha Christie. What was the name of that snake again, oh yeah, a BOOMSLANG  has quite a ring to it, doesn't it.<br /><br />Let's make it a PERUVIAN BOOMSLANG! Sure, Steve, that's great  except that BOOMSLANG is Afrikaans, you moron! But how can you really tell that the target audience is children, and not simply mental defects? It's easy: There's no sex.<br /><br />Well, there is, but it's the kind glimpsed through a crack in the door to our parent's bedroom. Modern filmmakers are really big on the erotic aspects of the genre, the monster, the female victim, the chase.<br /><br />But unlike UNIVERSAL and LEWTON they have no idea what's going on. All that's really left is the giggling outside the SM club and the Fascist credo that people with sexual preferences are intrinsically evil.<br /><br />In spite of a certain discrepancy in size, King Kong knew exactly what to do with Fay Wray. Freddy Krueger can only kill her.<br /><br />And since there's no real titillation in that, he has to torture her first  not in any way that might excite her, you understand, since that would upset our puritan sentiments. And so, horror and romanticism become simply unpleasantness and the grooming of psychopaths.<br /><br />Our hero, you see, is a rubber fetishist, and can only get a boner if someone touches him you know down there with you know  rubber gloves (giggle). And that's what they use in autopsies, and that's how they discover that he is, in fact, you know.<br /><br />Obviously, this is the author at the height of his inspirational powers.

r29852	I approached this movie with the understanding that it was one of the worst flicks ever made. I sat down to watch it with this mindset, and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It's not great. It's not even that good; in fact, it's pretty poor. However, it's not as bad as I had been led to believe, by a long shot. It's pretty inept, and, evidently as a cost cutting measure, a lot of stock footage is pressed into service, a lot of which has no apparent relation to the narrative.<br /><br />What it is, however, is an intensely personal movie made by a man who evidently did not have the skills or the funding to do his idea justice. Before you discount _Glen or Glenda?_ out of hand, examine your own artistic skills. Me, I'd love to be able to draw, but anything I try to sketch comes out like stick men. I'd love to be able to sing, but all I do is frighten young children.<br /><br />Wood had an idea, and unfortunately he didn't have what it takes to make it work. However, this was an incredibly daring movie for the puritan 50s, however exploitative or incoherent it may appear at first glance.	i approach this movie with the understanding that it was one of the worst flick ever made i sat down to watch it with this mindset and was pleasant surprise it s not great it s not even that good in fact it s pretty poor however it s not a bad a i had been l to believe by a long shot it s pretty inept and evident a a cost cutting measure a lot of stock footage i pressed to service a lot of which ha no apparent relation to the narrative what it i however i an intense personal movie made by a man who evident did not have the skill or the funding to do hi idea justice before you count or Glenda out of hand examine your own artistic skill me i d love to be able to draw but anything i try to sketch come out like stick men i d love to be able to sing but all i do i frighten young children wood had an idea and fortunate he t have what it take to make it work however this was an credibly daring movie for the puritan however exploitative or coherent it may appear at first glance	negative

Clayburgh's timid-appearing husband is killed in car crash as she is getting ready to go to Rome and sing as a diva. Matthew objects but comes along. He connects with the young girl again but this time, Matt is on cocaine. His superb voice, lovely, impetuous mother is in the limelight. She doesn't know how to handle Matt's addiction. The movie drags on in search of a plot. Clayburgh is in the wrong role and Bertolucci may have had his head in the moon while directing the picture.

r22102	"Ewww! A Disney sequel that is rubbish! Who would have thought it? Actually, quite a lot judging by the comments here, and they aren't wrong. I actually looked forward to seeing this awful film based on my liking of the original. And therein lies Disney's whole ""cash-in"" mentality. Shovel out any old junk on the back of a success and people will go for it. Don't think they are that cynical? Ask yourself this, then....How many Disney films have sequels? And then....How many of those sequels spawn a follow-up? A significantly lower number.<br /><br />Kronk's New Groove is just another example of this. The plot is laughably simplistic and drawn out. Even more annoying was the increased number of ""out of place"" items and scenes - an old folks home for example and, God forbid an Aztec version of the Boy Scouts! Worse yet, Kronk's opposing Chippamunk leader has a completely bewildering over-the-top English accent for no reason whatsoever. An accent that was, after a very short while, intensely grating on the nerves.<br /><br />There are a couple of good things. The animation is very nice and the voice talent do well with the sub-standard dialogue they are given - especially Warburton in the lead role. But other than this there really is nothing to recommend it.

r49483	"Just got my copy of this DVD two disc set and while not perfect, I found the overall experience to be a fun way to waste some time. I have to say right up front that I am a huge fan of Zombie movies, and I truly think that the fine people who made these films must be too. I also have a soft spot for people who are trying, sometimes against all odds, to live a dream. And again, these people are doing it. Is this some award-winning collection of amazing film? No. Not even close. But for what they do on their meager budgets, these films should be recommended. For me, the bottom line is always, was I entertained? Did I have a good time with this movie? And here the answer to both was ""Yes."" The first in the series is also the most raw. It opens with some kind of accident at a nuclear facility and people melt down or something. Cut to some years later and a new housing community is built over the old reactor site. Some kids making a video fall into a hole and find themselves trapped in the bottom levels of the facility. They get rescued, but the hole is not sealed and the people from the opening start lumbering out of the hole. Soon, the whole town is overtaken by the undead. And these zombies are fun. They go from cool rot makeup to the cheapest slap on white-face ever, but they are fun. The whole movie culminates in a showdown between the final survivors of the area and the undead, with our heroes going into the reactor's lower levels to take out the flesh eating zombies and seal the hole forever! Pretty cheesy, but I think it was meant to be. Still, it moves very fast, has buckets of gruesome effects and really tries to have some style. The acting is uneven, but a few good performances shine through and one really should listen to the commentary track. I went back and watched it again with that on and found it to be a good bit of information on the trials and fun that the crew and cast experienced on the movie. Director Todd Sheets seems pretty proud of this, his first film, but also has no delusions. He knows it's a trashy zombie movie, but he does show respect to people involved. Also, Sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field. The behind the scenes of Zombie Bloodbath is pretty fun as well. I felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for. There are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage, mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like CNN, FOX and MTV. Over all, a fun little film that is VERY rough around the edges, but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride! I have seen many DV films, and some shot of video films, and many are quite dull, but this one really wasn't. While newer DV films are technically superior, they just aren't fun! Overall, this is a solid, if a bit flawed, release with plenty of extras and TONS of gore and splatter. While not breaking any grand rules of move making, I found the series to be fun and always a laugh, so I give this set a solid recommendation. Todd Sheets was not trying to make award winning art here folks, he was trying, sometimes against all odds it seems, to make fun zero budget, splattery horror and to that end, he has succeeded in spades."	just got my copy of this DVD two disc set and while not perfect i found the overall experience to be a fun way to waste some time i have to say right up front that i am a huge fan of zombie movie and i truly think that the fine people who made these film must be too i also have a soft spot for people who are trying sometime against all odds to live a dream and again these people are doing it i this some award winning collection of amazing film no not even close but for what they do on their meager budget these film should be commend for me the bottom line i always was i entertain did i have a good time with this movie and here the answer to both was yes the first in the series i also the most raw it open with some kind of accident at a nuclear facility and people melt down or something cut to some year late and a new housing community i built over the old actor site some kid making a video fall to a hole and find themselves trapped in the bottom level of the facility they get rescue but the hole i not seal and the people from the opening start lumbering out of the hole soon the whole town i overtaken by the and these zombie are fun they go from cool rot makeup to the cheap slap on white face ever but they are fun the whole movie culminate in a showdown between the final survivor of the area and the with our heroes going to the actor s lower level to take out the flesh eat zombie and seal the hole forever pretty cheesy but i think it was meant to be still it move very fast ha bucket of gruesome effect and real try to have some style the acting i uneven but a few good performance shine through and one real should listen to the commentary track i went back and watch it again with that on and found it to be a good bit of information on the trial and fun that the crew and cast experience on the movie director Todd sheet seem pretty proud of this hi first film but also ha no delusion he know it s a trashy zombie movie but he does show respect to people involved also sheet ha a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that other could learn from in the movie field the behind the scene of zombie bloodbath i pretty fun a well i felt it was almost a entertaining a the film it was made for there are some great interview and behind the scene footage mixed with news story about the film from some major place like CNN fox and MTV over all a fun little film that i very rough around the edge but still had me laughing and enjoy the ride i have seen many film and some shot of video film and many are quite dull but this one real t while new film are technical superior they just t fun overall this i a solid if a bit flaw release with plenty of extra and ton of gore and splatter while not break any grand rule of move making i found the series to be fun and always a laugh so i give this set a solid commendation Todd sheet was not trying to make award winning art here folk he was trying sometime against all odds it seem to make fun zero budget horror and to that end he ha succeed in spade	positive
r403	"If you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization, there is an excellent book called ""Outlaw Seas"" or ""The Outlaw Sea"", and it describes, in story after story, how these things do happen. The lawlessness of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons. One, many of the world's freighters are of questionable registry (nationality) and it's difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners don't have an office in a real country. Two, many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries. The crews are often (like illegal immigrant workers) threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices. Three, there is often a language barrier, not only between the officers and the crew, but also between the crew members themselves. The crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence. Four, once committing an illegal act, the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint. Anyway, it's fascinating reading.<br /><br />Horrifying story, excellent movie. Does anyone else notice how HBO seems to make the best and most important movies?

r38341	Such a long awaited movie.. But it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day.. From the trailers it looked like a action movie, but it turned out to be a out & out comedy(a bad comedy). But one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors, they've done their part of the movie very well. Good acting, but i don't think that can save the movie.. India has been shot beautifully. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) were all saturated with color, alright. Nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when I could go there ;-)<br /><br />Action sequences were shot very shabbily, no one could make out head & tail of the stunts, they've used Akki(akshay kumar) very well but could've been done much much better..<br /><br />Animation is the worst i've seen in recent movies(90's movies had better animation scenes i guess(initial scene where the car is falling off 'flying should be better word' the road into lake).<br /><br />And the movies name has been mentioned nearly every 20 to 30 mins, just to make sure audiences don't forget the movie name i guess..	such a long await movie but it ha appoint me and my friend who had gone to see the movie on the first day from the trail it look like a action movie but it turn out to be a out out comedy a bad comedy but one thing that serve appreciation i the acting by these professional actor they done their part of the movie very well good acting but i don t think that can save the movie India ha been shot beautiful were all saturated with color alright nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these place was shot made me want to find out exact where those place were and when i could go there action sequence were shot very shabbily no one could make out head tail of the stunt they used very well but could been done much much better animation i the worst i seen in recent movie s movie had better animation scene i guess initial scene where the car i fall off flying should be better word the road to lake and the movie name ha been mentioned near every to just to make sure audience don t forget the movie name i guess	negative
r14340	....You get this stupid excuse of a Child's Play rip-off! Man, what were they thinking? First they mess with a Rumpelstiltskin horror movie then they make crap like this. Fariy Tale haters! Well to be honest, I've seen this as a kid, and it scared me a bit a lot, simply because I was under aged with the assumption that Pinocchio wouldn't do that, wah wah wah. But I've grown and come to think of this as Child's Play rip, a fairy tale bashing nonsense, and a lame Tales From The Crypt episode, or trying to be one at least, with a lame ending that was stupid, and it had many plot holes, and I still can't understand how it came to life. Was it the work of an evil Geppetto? Then what, after a few evil deeds, he becomes a real boy who becomes America's Most Wanted? Personally, I think the concept of an evil Geppetto sounds better, he builds an army of wooden killers, and starts a crime wave, funny. But this is awful, awful, awful, awful, AWFUL! AWFUL! Stinky like a shoe, and awful! IT SUCKED IT SUCKED! If you want killer puppets, settle for the killer doll, specifically Child's Play, instead, no strings attached.

r21654	"With an opening segment that imitates the music and cinematography of Todd Haynes's Safe (1995), David Lynch uses dream, myth and warped notions of reality to tell the fractured story of a failed bit-part Hollywood actress/waitress, Diane Selwyn, let down by fame and her own demons and obsessed with Camilla Rhodes, who is engaged to hotshot director Adam Kesher.<br /><br />The film effectively takes place in Diane's drug-fueled head; we are witness to her crazy distortions, her wish-fulfillments, regrets, obsessions and fears. Using the dream narrative as a way of presenting two notions of reality in conflict, Lynch does not simplify the opposition between reality and fantasy but actively entangles them. The last 45 minutes are as dream-like as what came before; and the troublesome air of detached, otherworldly ambiguity still pervades, fracturing the seemingly secure distinction between reality and dream we expect to see in films about nightmares and dreams.<br /><br />Lynch's film borrows from many films, old and new, but ultimately is a film unlike any other with the exception of the director's own Lost Highway and Blue Velvet. It constantly challenges the viewer to interpret what is seen, not only intuitively but intellectually. Yet it is not as pretentious as one would have imagined because Lynch makes us sympathize with the protagonist despite her murderous deeds - an element that was missing in all of his other films except the Straight Story. He does this by presenting Diane's dream alter-ego, Betty, as a wholesome Canadian farm girl destined for fame. Lynch also presents us with an intriguing story that affirms and negates in equal measure. Are Camilla and Diane really lovers or just friends? Who is the blue-lady? What does she signify? Who is the bum behind Winkies? What is the significance of the rotting corpse at Sierra Bonita? Does Aunt Ruth really exist? Is silencio an abstraction of hell or perhaps a self-referential take on the film's status as fiction? Lynch isn't prepared to answer any question he poses, choosing instead to present his ""love story in the city of dreams"" as a set of interconnected abstractions and motifs.<br /><br />The acting is top rate, especially Naomi Watts as Diane Selwyn/Betty, who is yet to eclipse this performance. Laura Harring has the requisite Hayworthesque allure as Camilla/Rita, while Adam Theroux as Adam brings an freewheeling arrogance and sublimated paranoid aggression to his role. It was staggering and a grave injustice that not one of them was even nominated for an Academy Award.<br /><br />This is a film that demands to be seen and analyzed closely. The mystery at the heart of the film remains in Lynch's hands but half the fun is finding consistent ideas from the maze of seeming incongruities that he presents. Upon closer inspection there is a definite sense of a puzzle, perhaps an incomplete jigsaw that teases us with closure but denies the imaginary plenitude of narrative coherence. Ultimately, this is Lynch's key film."	with an opening segment that imitate the music and cinematography of Todd Haynes s safe David lynch use dream myth and warp notion of reality to tell the fracture story of a fail bit part Hollywood actress waitress Diane let down by fame and h own demon and obsess with Camilla Rhodes who i engage to hotshot director Adam the film effective take place in Diane s drug fuel head we are witness to h crazy distortion h wish regret obsession and fear use the dream narrative a a way of present two notion of reality in conflict lynch does not simplify the opposition between reality and fantasy but active entangle them the last minute are a dream like a what came before and the troublesome air of detach otherworldly ambiguity still pervade fracture the seeming secure distinction between reality and dream we expect to see in film about nightmare and dream lynch s film borrow from many film old and new but ultimate i a film unlike any other with the exception of the director s own lost highway and blue velvet it constant challenge the viewer to interpret what i seen not on intuitive but intellectual yet it i not a pretentious a one would have imagine because lynch make u sympathize with the protagonist despite h murderous ed an element that was miss in all of hi other film except the straight story he does this by present Diane s dream alter ego Betty a a wholesome Canadian farm girl destine for fame lynch also present u with an intriguing story that affirm and negate in equal measure are Camilla and Diane real love or just friend who i the blue lady what does she signify who i the bum behind what i the significance of the rotting corpse at sierra Bonita does aunt Ruth real exist i an abstraction of hell or perhaps a self referential take on the film s status a fiction lynch t prepared to answer any question he pose choose instead to present hi love story in the city of dream a a set of interconnect abstraction and motif the acting i top rate especial Naomi watt a Diane Betty who i yet to eclipse this performance Laura ha the requisite allure a Camilla Rita while Adam a Adam bring an freewheel arrogance and sublimate paranoid aggression to hi role it was staggering and a grave justice that not one of them was even nominate for an academy award this i a film that demand to be seen and analyze close the mystery at the heart of the film remain in lynch s hand but half the fun i finding consistent idea from the maze of seeming congruity that he present upon close inspection there i a definite sense of a puzzle perhaps an incomplete jigsaw that tease u with closure but deny the imaginary plenitude of narrative coherence ultimate this i lynch s key film	positive

r46418	Very rarely do I give less rave reviews on a show or film I dislike on IMDb, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is just so painstakingly dreadful, it's terrible.<br /><br />I wouldn't have minded if this had been an animated series- would've been better that way I guess, but as a live-action show, it typifies the terms 'cheesy' and 'campy'. Of which Power Rangers is. Five multi- coloured, spandex wearing teens battle evil by using their martial arts skills. The costumes are horrid- they look like something that is reminiscent of what track and field athletes and female gymnasts would wear. The acting is woeful, and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to watch, it makes Jean- Claude Van Damme, look as equally as good as Bruce Lee, which is an understatement in itself. In fact, they look as if they are jumping and dancing about; like it was some version of the 'Nutcracker', or they were doing ballet, rather than fighting. Besides, there are some cartoons that heavily feature martial arts and yet it is done in a fun-yet not so cheesy way that makes it look silly.<br /><br />Kids show or not, this is just so lame and on the verge of absurdity. And even though this version is set in America, you could be forgiven into thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences that they were not filmed in the US, but rather in Japan; thus the somewhat 'fake' fighting and footage was borrowed from the Japanese version-only to be juxtaposed onto the US version.<br /><br />If you like this type of thing, then stick with Sentai- the Japanese equivalent.	very rare do i give less rave view on a show or film i like on but mighty power rang i just so painstaking dreadful it s terrible i t have minded if this had been an animated series would been better that way i guess but a a live action show it typify the term cheesy and campy of which power rang i five multi spandex wear teen battle evil by use their martial art skill the costume are horrid they look like something that i reminiscent of what track and field athlete and female gymnast would wear the acting i woeful and the fight choreography i so shocking bad and so lame to watch it make jean Claude van look a equal a good a Bruce lee which i an understatement in itself in fact they look a if they are jump and dancing about like it was some version of the nutcracker or they were doing ballet rather than fighting beside there are some cartoon that heavily feature martial art and yet it i done in a fun yet not so cheesy way that make it look silly kid show or not this i just so lame and on the verge of absurdity and even though this version i set in America you could be forgiven to think that a you watch some of the fight sequence that they were not film in the US but rather in japan thus the somewhat fake fighting and footage was borrow from the Japanese version on to be juxtapose onto the US version if you like this type of thing then stick with the Japanese equivalent	negative
r33859	Isabelle Huppert portrays a talented female piano teacher who is staid, unfriendly and distant in public, and bitter towards her students. Privately, she seethes with violence and frustration, and her sexual life is solitary and perverse. She lives with her overbearing mother, who obsessively drives her to become noticed (and so advance in life) as a talented pianist. The key to the characters of both mother and daughter is 'obsession.' These characters cannot change their impulses anymore than a rabbit caught in headlights can avoid death.<br /><br />The piano teacher meets a young, attractive, talented pianist who from the beginning is attracted to her. They start a relationship in the most unconventional way, but from the outset she makes perverse and violent terms that he must perform on her, which sickens him enough to want to terminate the relationship before it has really begun.<br /><br />The film ties itself to the female lead. Isabelle Huppert amazes with a brutal, completely convincing performance as the piano teacher. She cleverly shows a woman who is drawn to beauty and perversion, but her violence is fed by her perverted impulses. As a film that is so character driven, you know it would not work half as well, had she acted poorly.<br /><br />This is powerful, intelligently acted, and intelligently and sensitively adapted from the novel. The camera work also suits the film. There are what I can only think to call, framing shots where the director holds a scene and forces the eye to dart about. This is done extremely effectively against a blank bathroom wall, and is a further testament to the director's mastery.<br /><br />Expect to be disturbed and sickened by this film. But, be brave - have the guts to go and see it. This is a very private look into essentially one person's life, but do not expect to be entertained in the Hollywood sense....there are no car chases in this film!

Later on I began thinking - the Linkin Park posters on the wall and everything else seemed to hint that I was dealing with a more recent film. Realizing that, the flick became an unbearable torment. The last 3 minutes were the longest in the movie history - the film just refused to end. Is there a genre such as ""horror for children""? In that case this film is definitely it. If there are parents, perverse enough to want to introduce their offspring to horror, I suggest this would be perfect for kids of about 6-8.

r8132	If you had a mother that described you like that, you just might be looking to bump her off yourself. It's how Danny DeVito feels about Anne Ramsey, it's just how to put the plan in action.<br /><br />And his creative writing class taught by Professor Billy Crystal gives him the idea. That and a viewing of Alfred Hitchcock's classic Strangers On A Train which gives DeVito the idea to switch murders with Crystal who hates his wife, Kate Mulgrew, who not only is cheating him out of an idea for a book he wanted to write, but is also carrying on with hunky Tony Ciccone.<br /><br />Throw Momma From The Train plays out kind of like Strangers On A Train as DeVito seems to have carried out his end of the murder scheme. But Crystal's having a bit of a problem putting Ramsey down even with Danny's help. That woman might need killing, but she's going to take a lot of it.<br /><br />The only Academy recognition that Throw Momma From The Train got was an Academy Award nomination for Anne Ramsey for Best Supporting Actress. Ramsey lost to Olympia Dukakis for Moonstruck, but the film turned out to be her finest hour. Ramsey already had the throat cancer that would eventually kill her the following year, but look at the list of credits she managed to amass even after Throw Momma From The Train, she worked right up to the end.<br /><br />I've seen interviews with both of the stars of Throw Momma From The Train, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito, and both have gladly conceded that Anne Ramsey's performance as the mother from hell both made the film the success it was and stole it out from under them. Their acknowledgment of Ramsey's talent and performance is the best possible tribute.<br /><br />If Marion Lorne in Strangers On A Train had been anything like Anne Ramsey here, Farley Granger would gladly have joined Robert Walker in disposing of her.

r21524	In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected. There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment. This one wasn't even released on VHS to my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the making (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut). It's obviously a product of the sixties but so is just about everything else from that era. All films reflect the tastes and customs of the times in which they are made. This was released the same year as The President's Analyst, another absurd masterpiece. That film was finally released on DVD and has developed a cult following. This film has many memorable bizarre, goofy, wacky moments. Sure, it's painted in broad strokes and has silly go-go music throughout but that's part of its charm. It creates its own absurd universe. If whoever is in charge of DVD production for Columbia Pictures releases (I believe Columbia released it) takes polls for new releases this gets my vote.	in this era when almost everything make it on to DVD i m expect to see the my mother the car collection any day now this film ha been unfair neglect there are numerable stupid comedy from the s a well a many other era that have receive at least a cursory DVD treatment this one t even released on VHS to my knowledge despite the talent involved in the making Arthur Eli Anne Jackson Murray notable late for co writing tootsie even Dustin Hoffman in hi debut it s obvious a duct of the sixty but so i just about everything else from that era all film reflect the taste and custom of the time in which they are made this was released the same year a the president s analyst another absurd masterpiece that film was final released on DVD and ha developed a cult following this film ha many memorable bizarre goofy wacky moment sure it s painted in broad stroke and ha silly go go music throughout but that s part of it charm it create it own absurd universe if whoever i in charge of DVD production for Columbia picture lease i believe Columbia released it take poll for new lease this get my vote	positive
r16758	"Having watched this film years ago, it never faded from my memory. I always thought this was the finest performance by Michelle Pfeiffer that I've seen. But, I am astounded by the number of negative reviews that this film has received. After seeing it once more today, I still think it is powerful, moving and couldn't care less if it is ""based loosely on King Lear"".<br /><br />I now realize that this is the greatest performance by Jessica Lange that I've ever seen - and she has had accolades for much shallower efforts.<br /><br />A Thousand Acres is complex, human, vibrant and immensely moving, but surely doesn't present either of the primary female leads with any touch of glamour or ""sexiness"". I don't think this is well received in these times.<br /><br />Perhaps one reason for this film's underwhelming response lies in the fact that the writer (Jane Smiley(, screenplay (Laura Jones), and director (Jocelhyn Moorehouse) are all women.

r14812	Orson Welles manages to knock me on my ass with every picture of his I see. Lady of Shanghai is on the same level as his other masterpieces, The Magnificent Ambersons, Touch of Evil, The Trial, and Chimes at Midnight. The plot can tend to be confusing sometimes, and sometimes it seems to be moving maybe a tiny bit too fast (about an hour of it was edited out when test screenings went poorly). It doesn't matter, however. You can't watch Welles' films and manage to concentrate too much on the plot. His direction defines what great direction is. Almost any scene from this film can hold up with any other scene he directed. Check out the courtroom scene. Usually they are such stock scenes that I can't stand them. Case in point, try to sit through Welles' own speech near the end of Compulsion. In Lady from Shanghai, just pay attention to the level of detail in that courtroom scene. Watch that juror who is always sneezing and interrupting the proceedings. Or just take a look at the lighting in that scene. I know, it is just a simple Venetian blind, and that it was used constantly in film noirs and crime films of the era, but Welles gives it a beauty all its own. The dialogue is also remarkable. Welles had the skill, a skill that no one else seemed to have, to make a crime film containing examples of the grandest poetry. Whether he was speaking Shakespeare or spitting out hard-boiled lines, it had the power to stir the soul. 10/10.

The actors, again term used loosely, are awful, in fact almost none of them did anything ever again which is a relief. The scenery and everything about this screams, we had 7 dollars to work with and a day to do it in. Was this filmed in someones back yard? Everything about this project says, low budget. The actors at best were D list. Do not waste your time, unless of course you want to take it back and try to get the rental back. The lead bad guy looks like that punk from the 70s show that ended up marrying his grandmother dummee moore. My local blockbuster video store lists this as the movie most returned with sad commentary attached. Even as a 99 cent rental this flick gathers dust. Someone really must have owed some favors.

r27306	"""The Invisible Mouse"" is a delightful and different Tom & Jerry's cartoon. It features the usual cat/mouse chases and battles, but in a different way this time. Jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of ""surprises"" for Tom, scare him, torment him and confuse him.<br /><br />As much as it is weird, it's also very cool and funny to see what we can't see: Jerry invisible. It's amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who's doing it (we know who, right?) - it's like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts. It's equally amusing to see Jerry eating some candies and fruits while he's invisible. I really like that instrumental music which plays when he's not visible.<br /><br />Some of the best jokes on this short are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and slams him and even when Tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and Jerry writes ""Missed me"". I also like when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk, becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face.<br /><br />Overall, this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, fun and some nice artwork too."	the visible mouse i a delightful and different tom Jerry s cartoon it feature the usual cat mouse chase and battle but in a different way this time Jerry accidental fall in a bottle of visible ink and i obvious very glad about this because he realize that he can prepare lot of surprise for tom scare him torment him and confuse him a much a it i weird it s also very cool and funny to see what we can t see Jerry visible it s amusing to see the lift up in the air without seeing who s doing it we know who right it s like those the had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghost it s equal amusing to see Jerry eat some candy and fruit while he s visible i real like that instrumental music which play when he s not visible some of the best joke on this short are when tom see Jerry s shadow and slam him and even when tom try to slam him with a fry pan and Jerry write missed me i also like when Jerry drink tom s chocolate milk becoming visible again and with a happy look on hi face overall this short ha the basic ingredient needed for a classic cartoon humor entertainment fun and some nice artwork too	positive

The acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. There is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. It is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience.

I don't know if it was his poor acting or simply a bad script, but would say it was both. Considering the casting of him in this role, I found it difficult to root for him even to the very end. I wished he'd have died in battle or one of the sword/knife scuffles.<br /><br />Then, the tinder for the plot to kill the king was because the king didn't have dinner and sex with his Queen? Pretty lame. And to go to the extreme to kill her own son? And to then push up her lover as succeeding King?

r15048	"In short:<br /><br />Spike Lee clearly has a lot on his mind. He's thinking about racism color-ism, media and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, 'hetero-sexism', politics of the drug war etc etc...<br /><br />That level of consciousness on is own is great. I think it is a blessing that more and more people are choosing to critically examine fundamental aspects of our daily lives; the silent and invisible forces that govern our societies. However, just because Lee is making contentious films does not make him a good film-maker.<br /><br />What comes across in ""Jungle Fever"" is a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces. This is largely the result of two main failures:<br /><br />firstly, Lee is simply trying too hard. He seems to be desperately trying to accommodate every political/social statement he can think of into the 90mins. And as such, the end result seems confused and irresolute as he allows himself no time to develop characters that can fully embody the ideas he hopes to present. And so he exhausts stereotypes and we are left with rushed testimonies and very loaded dialogs. The end result is very staged and unrealistic.<br /><br />Secondly, by attempting to make statements about such a wide variety of societal functions, he appears to have no concrete or original interpretation of the social/political issues presented. What comes across is a puddle of regurgitated non-sense. You feel that he bought an elementary level sociology text book and spewed out all 500 pages.<br /><br />These are highly problematic features because the artistry of film is sacrificed and the work is transformed into a loudspeaker for the voice of the voice of the filmmaker. He is unable to distance himself from the work, and allow it to speak for itself.<br /><br />It functions neither as a piece of art nor a sound political argument.<br /><br />Although I still do appreciate Lee bringing up these important issues, I must say:<br /><br />Two thumbs down."	in short spike lee clear ha a lot on hi mind he s think about racism color ism media and hegemony consumerism and capitalism religion sexism hetero sexism politics of the drug war etc etc that level of consciousness on i own i great i think it i a blessing that more and more people are choose to critical examine fundamental aspect of our daily live the silent and visible force that govern our society however just because lee i making contentious film does not make him a good film maker what come across in jungle fever i a superficial understanding of these political force this i large the result of two main failure first lee i simply trying too hard he seem to be desperate trying to accommodate every political social statement he can think of to the and a such the end result seem confused and irresolute a he allow himself no time to develop character that can fully embody the idea he hope to present and so he exhaust stereotype and we are left with rush testimony and very load the end result i very stag and realistic second by attempt to make statement about such a wide variety of societal function he appear to have no concrete or original interpretation of the social political issue present what come across i a puddle of regurgitate non sense you feel that he bought an elementary level sociology text book and spew out all page these are high problematic feature because the artistry of film i sacrifice and the work i transform to a loudspeaker for the voice of the voice of the filmmaker he i able to distance himself from the work and allow it to speak for itself it function neither a a piece of art nor a sound political argument although i still do appreciate lee bring up these important issue i must say two thumb down	negative

Otherwise, it's likely you'll miss the references to 80's cop films and simply think it's a running gag about a walking rectum. Think it's brainless, infantile poop humor? Go watch the Stallone film 'Cobra' and you'll see what I mean. This show actually has very subtle humor, which says a lot, both for a show that aired on adult swim, and for a show about a walking ass.<br /><br />All the standard genre clichés are in place that made movies like Dirt Harry and Cobra so great and ripe for parody. Sanchez is Assy's partner, who is - as per the genre - level-headed and constantly apologizing for his partner's homicidal behavior. The police chief is, of course, a fire-breathing hard case who lives to scream ""I want your badge on my desk first thing tomorrow morning!"" The over-the-top, and sometimes completely nonsensical manner in which the 1980's 'Renegade Cop' film is parodied suits the subject matter well. For instance, while breaking up a bus robbery, one of the criminals stops to ask Assy, ""Hey, where are you going, asshole!?"" To which the title character snaps off the one-liner: ""I'm going... to shoot you."" <br /><br />Highly recommended for anybody who loves 80's action movies, and has actually viewed enough of them to understand the humor."

r31563	When you first sit down to watch this movie, keep in mind that you are about to see something you've probably never seen before. Keep in mind that this is a movie where they obviously spent INSANE amounts of cash on explosions and not enough on acting or anything else for that matter. The crazy thing I noticed is that every character is completely over-portrayed, and it seems (most of the time anyhow) that the film had been 'sped-up' to make the characters move faster! (I wonder if the Hong Kong version was dubbed too?) I understand the cartoon had this, but it doesn't work for live-action. It just looks odd... as if the camera crew decided to act because they couldn't afford real actors.<br /><br />The English version is horribly dubbed, and the character's words do not match the mouths at all. I would have preffered subtitles, but since this is a kids movie, and since some kids cannot read well, I'll let it go. But there is something extremely odd about this movie. It's supposedly a kids movie, but there's a lot of material about SEX, RAPE, and STRIPPING which isn't exactly for young Western audiences. (In the Orient, they have different laws and sexuality in children's movies is much more accepted). But parents be warned! There is a scene where two characters talk about rape, multiple scenes where people say 'sex maniac' and a scene where this insanely young japanese girl does a sexy dance for one of the 'sex maniacs' and shows him her breasts! Who was this movie made for anyway?<br /><br />Oh, and the special effects are laughable. You can tell the spaceship-like things that bomb the village are cardboard cutouts (or animation, I wasn't sure) that look unconvincing, even to a kid. The makers of this movie left out a lot of cool things from the cartoon, simply because they couldn't budget the kind of money they'd need. I didn't like how the names of all the characters were changed... it made me wonder if this movie was made by the same people as Dragon Ball Z.<br /><br />I don't really recommed this movie to anyone. Kids, adults, or Dragon Ball Z fans. It's just a poor representation of the cartoon, and obviously, one will be able to tell that this movie was rushed and no care whatsoever was put into it. I won't even get into the camerawork... just wait until the end credits at the still picture that sits there for 2 minutes... most of the shots are not framed correctly AT ALL and the movie just seems made by amateurs. Grainy film quality too.<br /><br />Just all around horrible!!!!<br /><br />	when you first sit down to watch this movie keep in mind that you are about to see something you probably never seen before keep in mind that this i a movie where they obvious spent insane amount of cash on explosion and not enough on acting or anything else for that matter the crazy thing i noticed i that every character i complete over portray and it seem most of the time anyhow that the film had been sped up to make the character move fast i wonder if the Hong Kong version was dubbed too i understand the cartoon had this but it t work for live action it just look odd a if the camera crew decided to act because they t afford real actor the English version i horribly dubbed and the character s word do not match the mouths at all i would have subtitle but since this i a kid movie and since some kid cannot read well i ll let it go but there i something extreme odd about this movie it s supposed a kid movie but there s a lot of material about sex rape and stripping which t exact for young western audience in the orient they have different law and sexuality in children s movie i much more accepted but parent be warn there i a scene where two character talk about rape multiple scene where people say sex maniac and a scene where this sane young girl does a sexy dance for one of the sex maniac and show him h breast who was this movie made for anyway oh and the special effect are laugh you can tell the spaceship like the that bomb the village are cardboard cutout or animation i t sure that look convincing even to a kid the maker of this movie left out a lot of cool the from the cartoon simply because they t budget the kind of money they d need i t like how the name of all the character were changed it made me wonder if this movie was made by the same people a dragon ball z i don t real this movie to anyone kid adult or dragon ball z fan it s just a poor presentation of the cartoon and obvious one will be able to tell that this movie was rush and no care whatsoever was put to it i won t even get to the camerawork just wait until the end credit at the still picture that sit there for 2 minute most of the shot are not framed correct at all and the movie just seem made by amateur grainy film quality too just all around horrible	negative
r19764	"To be honest, i'm surprised by the positive votes that this film has received. The movie just drags along its 81 minute life span, and the audience has to suffer the whole way through. Actually there are some positive moments in this film; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. She is given some pretty pathetic dialogue and she handles it pretty well. Scott Valentine(Merrideth's boyfriend in Family Ties), on the other hand, is a pretty rough watch. I guess the highlight of his performance is witnessing the guy laying on the beach wearing tiger-patterned chummies....give me a break. Also, Valentine gives us a boorish and pathetic portrayal of a suffering vampire who misses the day(to see a much more convincing rendition of the suffering vampire see Denice Duff in ""Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4""). The movie moves so slow and is only positively punctuated by, and to be honest, Charlie Spradling's dance scenes.

Too much blood, too much time, too much themes for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was horrible. The revenge, a very human behavior, not pretty at all, is shown in uncountable films and plays, as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in Spain about Catholicism . But what Mr Villaronga try, is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the film´s history. It is really a pity to see Angela Molina in this movie.

r31876	It's hard to believe that a movie this bad wasn't produced once, but four times! Most movies require a certain `suspension of reality' to enjoy, but this one takes it just too far. The basic scenario is an Air Force pilot who is shot down over a `Middle Eastern' country. The US government drags its feet in recovering him, leading the Pilot's son (Doug Masters) to attempt a rescue mission.<br /><br />The problem I have with the movie is that it depicts the US Air Force as one colossal joke. In the movie you'll find that Doug and his friends on the air base manage to secure two F-16's, all the munitions, the fuel, the Intel for the mission, and so on. Security on this base seems to be a joke. Nobody seems to have a problem that a sixteen-year-old kid is fully qualified to pilot an F-16!<br /><br />If that wasn't enough, you would think the producers would at least attempt to get the munitions right, since people like to see things `blow up'. Not so! Several times in the movie, Doug fires off AIM-9 Missiles on ground targets. AIM stands for `Air Intercept Missile', meaning a weapon used to strike targets in the AIR. He also fires off 15-20 missiles, where the maximum an F-16 can hold is 6 AIM-9's. The movie also lacks continuity. You'll see the aircraft configured with one set of munitions, and in the next scene, it has a totally different munitions package. Also, 20MM doesn't just completely destroy anything it touches! An F-16 will hold 500 rounds of 20MM, and it's mostly used for self-defense.<br /><br />I could go on forever with plot holes, flaws, and outright wrong information from the movie, but I won't bore you. If you're in the mood to see a good Air Force movie, your choices are rather slim. Most military movies deal either with the Army, Navy or Marines. Until Hollywood can come up with an Air Force movie on the lines of `Saving Private Ryan' or `A Few Good Men', we'll be forced to watch movies like the `Iron Eagle' series.<br /><br />	it s hard to believe that a movie this bad t produce once but four time most movie require a certain suspension of reality to enjoy but this one take it just too far the basic scenario i an air force pilot who i shot down over a middle eastern country the US government drag it feet in cover him leading the pilot s son Doug master to attempt a rescue mission the problem i have with the movie i that it depict the US air force a one colossal joke in the movie you ll find that Doug and hi friend on the air base manage to secure two f s all the munition the fuel the Intel for the mission and so on security on this base seem to be a joke nobody seem to have a problem that a sixteen year old kid i fully qualified to pilot an f if that t enough you would think the produce would at least attempt to get the munition right since people like to see the blow up not so several time in the movie Doug fire off aim 9 missile on ground target aim stand for air intercept missile meaning a weapon used to strike target in the air he also fire off missile where the maximum an f can hold i 6 aim 9 s the movie also lack continuity you ll see the aircraft figure with one set of munition and in the next scene it ha a total different munition package also t just complete destroy anything it touch an f will hold round of and it s most used for self defense i could go on forever with plot hole flaw and outright wrong information from the movie but i won t bore you if you re in the mood to see a good air force movie your choice are rather slim most military movie deal either with the army navy or marine until Hollywood can come up with an air force movie on the line of saving private Ryan or a few good men we ll be forced to watch movie like the iron eagle series	negative
r3397	"Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce, direct, finance and/or star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to? Is that a good thing? <br /><br />This film does not answer the latter question either way, but it does appear that without Curb, Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With. <br /><br />Like most new producers/directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for (Curb). And yet, is it a sensitive guy film? He isn't really a sensitive guy. Likable, sure. Relatable, indeed. <br /><br />What this film really is about is a bit hard to say, I can only relate what I took away from it. <br /><br />I rented the film because of the trailers, particularly the scene of a counselor portrayed by Amy Sedaris informing James Aaron (Garlin) that a particular woman is interested in him mainly because she is a ""chubby chaser."" I just about fell out of my seat. Based on that scene alone, I ran to my computer to write a note to myself to rent this movie. The reason - I thought the school counselor (Sedaris) was talking about Beth, portrayed by Sarah Silverman. I imagined a lightish romantic comedy between the foxy Silverman and the fat Garlin. I didn't think the story would be anything original, but that the dialogue would be snappy and the scenes would move along at a satisfying pace. In short, I thought it would be a comedy. <br /><br />It was intriguing that the film started out that way but then took a much much more realistic turn when Beth gives James the heave ho because ""I've never really been with a fat guy before."" That is how brutally we live life, and it was completely realistic. I applaud the decision. It just meant that Beth has now left the building and with her, the one snappy person in the film.<br /><br />James's relationship with his mother was also interesting. That part made me wonder if the whole concept did not start out as a play. It had that intricate feel to it. (The whole ""Marty"" movie within a movie thing was utterly lost on me, as I have never seen that film.)<br /><br />There were serious doubts I had about the character of James Aaron, though. Is it really possible that at 39 he had not had a serious relationship? And he is an actor? That did not really square with me. To me, his persona was less actor-y, and more corporate. I could not really buy his ordinariness either. No doubt he was extremely disappointed that things with Beth did not work out. We felt that. But then, did he really care? <br /><br />Another thing - how in the world can both he and his mother afford to move out at the same time? Hasn't he just lost his job? The last one he had? That was one reason he did not seem ordinary to me. Where's the funding for his life coming from? <br /><br />And yet, I have read reviews that talk about the realistic portrayal of urban loneliness, so there is that. Yes, it is very realistic, the way we must be satisfied with what we have because it is all that we have. The way we sort of disappear from ourselves and each other in interactions (James and Stella), some kind of self-effacement that takes place just to move on to the next moment. That, contrasted with the possibility of defining ourselves through our moments, our thoughts the way James had with Beth, it's really crushing.<br /><br />Very well done."	ha the proliferation of relative high quality show on the proliferate TV network made it possible for people to produce direct finance and or star in their own film who might otherwise not have been able to i that a good thing this film does not answer the latter question either way but it does appear that without curb Jeff would not have been able to make i want someone to eat cheese with like most new produce director Jeff s dependent piece heave a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he i primarily known for curb and yet i it a sensitive guy film he t real a sensitive guy likable sure relate indeed what this film real i about i a bit hard to say i can on relate what i took away from it i rent the film because of the trail particular the scene of a counselor portray by Amy form James Aaron that a particular woman i interested in him main because she i a chubby chaser i just about fell out of my seat base on that scene alone i ran to my computer to write a note to myself to rent this movie the reason i thought the school counselor was talk about Beth portray by Sarah i imagine a romantic comedy between the foxy and the fat i t think the story would be anything original but that the dialogue would be snappy and the scene would move along at a satisfying pace in short i thought it would be a comedy it was intriguing that the film start out that way but then took a much much more realistic turn when Beth give James the heave ho because i never real been with a fat guy before that i how brutal we live life and it was complete realistic i applaud the decision it just meant that Beth ha now left the building and with h the one snappy person in the film James s relationship with hi mother was also interesting that part made me wonder if the whole concept did not start out a a play it had that intricate feel to it the whole Marty movie within a movie thing was utter lost on me a i have never seen that film there were serious doubt i had about the character of James Aaron though i it real possible that at he had not had a serious relationship and he i an actor that did not real square with me to me hi persona was less actor y and more corporate i could not real buy hi ordinariness either no doubt he was extreme appoint that the with Beth did not work out we felt that but then did he real care another thing how in the world can both he and hi mother afford to move out at the same time t he just lost hi job the last one he had that was one reason he did not seem ordinary to me where s the funding for hi life coming from and yet i have read view that talk about the realistic portrayal of urban loneliness so there i that yes it i very realistic the way we must be satisfied with what we have because it i all that we have the way we sort of appear from ourselves and each other in interaction James and Stella some kind of self effacement that take place just to move on to the next moment that contrast with the possibility of fine ourselves through our moment our thought the way James had with Beth it s real crushing very well done	positive

r21814	"The movie starts out with its most intelligent joke, and goes downhill from there (pun intended). After that there's lots of potty humor and sexual situations. The beautiful women were the best part of the movie. Swear-word puns are not meant to be central idea jokes, but they try it here. The battle between the two groups in the local town (richies and poories) is an old tried and true setup, so how could it go wrong? Well, there is no reason to envy the ""richies"" nor any reason to feel sorry for the poories, so we can forget the central plot. The situational humor is all toilet or sexual aimed at teenagers, but only garners giggles, no true belly-laughs.<br /><br />The only thing that salvages the comedy for this movie is the character humor, with the blind man providing some rehashed, but seldom used setups, and the black bar owner providing the formulaic ""street"" or ""hood"" humor. <br /><br />OK, forget the jokes, there has to be some killer snowboarding shots since this was a commercial enterprise. Unfortunately, there was only 4 seconds of backdrop action that might be inspiring. The rest was all ""B"" grade tricks or worse. The big moment, where the main character rides ""the goat"", a man-killer ski run, did provide one shot where a small avalanche eats the stuntman. This was the best of the boarding in this movie. Any serious snowboarding fan will be disappointed with the quality of the stunts in the movie. <br /><br />As for the technical aspects of the movie, the soundtrack was average, which surprises, as those snowboarding documentaries are regularly filled with quality tunes.

r45087	"Sidney Franklin's ""The Good Earth"" has achieved classic status thanks to a timeless story and superb acting, especially from Luis Ranier, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of O-Lan. Rainers performance is so complete, she is nearly unrecognizable. Having very little dialogue throughout the entire film (and it is a long one), Rainer relies instead on facial and body language. She looks and acts Chinese to the point that anyone unfamiliar with her work could easily mistake her as such.<br /><br />The film remains relevant today because it explores the rags to riches story and the universal themes that come with it. When Lung and wife O-Lan finally achieve financial success after years of famine and poverty, they find a life full of possessions but lacking in meaning. It is only when they return to the earth after fighting off a swarm of locusts (the special effects used to create them are still incredible and beautiful to watch) that they again find fulfillment. A common formula told with the unique perspective of a Chinese family (especially for 1937) makes the film a classic. Money isn't worth anything without friends and family, a point that the film drives home perfectly in it's last 10 minutes with an emotionally fulfilling conclusion."

r29438	"The reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point. It's obvious he hasn't been young or innocent in a very long time, or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the well-meaning young characters actually thought they COULD make a difference by putting up posters and holding a rave for peace. If only it was that easy. But the cynics sit and sneer at people who earnestly try their best to make things better, as the situation gets worse and worse every single day. Well, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.<br /><br />The central theme is that revenge begets more revenge, which begets even more, in an ever-expanding bloodbath. Both sides will tell you tales of atrocities committed by the other side, which they think justify their committing even MORE in retaliation. Where does it end? And apparently he missed the significance of ""the bubble"" referred to in the name, which was that people living in Tel Aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on all around them, which is partly why they seemed so naive. (He also seemed to think that Ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without a problem, which tells me he wasn't paying attention when Ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered.) <br /><br />I found it very brave of the director, the screenplay writer, and both star-crossed lovers, to update the Romeo & Juliet story to a modern troubled land, and to make both lovers male. Let's be honest here: Very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female (young love wins all hearts) -- but when people's uneasiness with their sexuality is added to the fact that, incredibly, these same people would rather have them HATE each other, then the conclusion is inevitable."	the viewer who called this movie a bust ha clear missed the point it s obvious he t been young or innocent in a very long time or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the well meaning young character actual thought they could make a difference by putting up post and holding a rave for peace if on it was that easy but the cynic sit and sneer at people who earnest try their best to make the better a the situation get worse and worse every single day well if you re not part of the solute you re part of the problem the central theme i that revenge beget more revenge which beget even more in an ever expand bloodbath both side will tell you tale of atrocity committed by the other side which they think justify their committing even more in retaliation where does it end and apparent he missed the significance of the bubble referred to in the name which was that people living in tel are strange cut off from the ugly realities of what i going on all around them which i partly why they seem so naive he also seem to think that could slip through the checkpoint without a problem which tell me he t pay attention when relate the lay and problem he had encounter i found it very brave of the director the screenplay writer and both star cross love to update the romeo Juliet story to a modern troubled land and to make both love male let s be honest here very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female young love win all heart but when people s easiness with their sexuality i add to the fact that credibly these same people would rather have them hate each other then the conclusion i inevitable	positive
r6183	That's what t.v. should be. And Pushing Daisies lives up to those expectations. A beautifully crafted and well-designed show, Pushing Daisies is one of the few shows left on prime-time that has integrity, is good for the entire family and sparks your imagination. It's not about the normal action, sex, money or murder angles of every other show on t.v.

It's amazing the amount of effort that went into the detail, particularly recapturing the feel of the 1960's era, the Batcave set, Wayne Manor, the costumes, and the actors selected to play the younger versions of West, Ward, Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero, and Frank Gorshin! This 90 minutes is well worth your time, and is a delight to all fans of the classic 1960's ""Batman"" television series.

r40742	Hopelessly inept and dull movie in which the characters stand around in rooms or a rocket ship and talk endlessly. You might think things would perk up when they explore Mars but these scenes are filmed through a heavy red/orange filter which makes everything very murky. The Martian landscape/vegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are entirely unconvincing. There are echoes of 'Bride Of The Monster' when the heroine carefully winds the octopus like tentacle of a flesh eating plant around her before weakly thrashing about, the difference being that the Ed Wood film is a hundred times more entertaining. Better wear earplugs when watching otherwise the 'sci-fi' music score, repeated endlessly, will drive you insane. If you find yourself unable to sleep one night just slip this one into the VCR and your insomnia will be cured in no time.	hopeless inept and dull movie in which the character stand around in room or a rocket ship and talk endless you might think the would perk up when they explore mar but these scene are film through a heavy red orange filter which make everything very murky the martian landscape vegetation consist main of draw and the monster are entire convincing there are echoes of bride of the monster when the heroine careful wind the octopus like tentacle of a flesh eat plant around h before weak thrashing about the difference being that the ed wood film i a hundred time more entertaining better wear earplug when watch otherwise the sci music score repeated endless will drive you insane if you find yourself able to sleep one night just slip this one to the VCR and your insomnia will be cured in no time	negative
r7103	Here is the example of a film that was not well received when it was made, but whose standing seems to be raising in time. 'The Tenant' is quite an interesting work by Polanski, one of the first of his European exile. It is set in Paris, and as in so many other exile films the city, its streets, the Seine and especially the building where the action takes place play an important role. It is just that Polanski chooses his principal character not to be an American (as in 'Frantic' for example) but a Pole, as himself was when going West. There is actually a lot of personal commentary in this film, made at what must have been a time of crisis in the director's life, and the fact that he decided to play the lead role (and does it masterfully) may also be seen as some kind of exorcism.<br /><br />It's in a way a circular story. The hero named Trelkovsky rents an apartment in old Parisian building, inhabited by what seem to be first a well assorted team of grumpy old or just ridiculous neighbors. The previous tenant tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the window of the flat, and Trelkovsky has just the time to visit her in the hospital before she dies and meet there her young and beautiful friend Stella (a spectacled Isabelle Adjani in her first role after Truffaut's 'L'histoire d'Adele H.'). Soon the neighbors do not seem to be what they are, it's a conspiracy to make him crazy, or to make him enter the life and role of the dead girl. He fights, tries to run, enters the game and ends by entering the circle and slowly becoming her. The circle is closed.<br /><br />It's not the most believable story we may have seen or heard, but the strength of the film does not reside in the story but in the details of the psychology, in the slow degradation of the mental state of the hero, in the permanent balancing game between reality and delusion. To a certain extent it is not what happens on the screen that matters, but how it happens, reminding the classical 'Knife in the Water' made more than a decade before, at the end of the Polish period of Polanski. There are many details that are never explained, but then this is how mystery films must be and this is actually how life is sometimes. The feeling of claustrophobia slowly contaminates the viewer. Unfortunately some of the graphical details in the last part of the film are not too well executed and the English spoken dialogs (the film was made in English) almost neutralize the overall atmosphere. However, waiting for the final punch scene is very worth the patience.<br /><br />It's not the best film that Polanski made, yet has many good parts, it shows the hand and the style of the director, and was a significant step in the building of his career.	here i the example of a film that was not well receive when it was made but whose standing seem to be raise in time the tenant i quite an interesting work by Polanski one of the first of hi European exile it i set in Paris and a in so many other exile film the city it street the seine and especial the building where the action take place play an important role it i just that Polanski choose hi principal character not to be an American a in frantic for example but a pole a himself was when going west there i actual a lot of personal commentary in this film made at what must have been a time of crisis in the director s life and the fact that he decided to play the lead role and does it masterful may also be seen a some kind of exorcism it s in a way a circular story the hero named rent an apartment in old Parisian building inhabited by what seem to be first a well assort team of grumpy old or just ridiculous neighbor the previous tenant tried to commit suicide by jump out of the window of the flat and ha just the time to visit h in the hospital before she die and meet there h young and beautiful friend Stella a Isabelle in h first role aft Truffaut s l d Adele h soon the neighbor do not seem to be what they are it s a conspiracy to make him crazy or to make him enter the life and role of the dead girl he fight try to run enter the game and end by enter the circle and slow becoming h the circle i close it s not the most believable story we may have seen or heard but the strength of the film does not side in the story but in the tail of the psychology in the slow gradation of the mental state of the hero in the permanent balance game between reality and delusion to a certain extent it i not what happen on the screen that matte but how it happen mind the classical knife in the water made more than a decade before at the end of the polish period of Polanski there are many tail that are never explained but then this i how mystery film must be and this i actual how life i sometime the feeling of claustrophobia slow contaminate the viewer fortunate some of the graphical tail in the last part of the film are not too well execute and the English spoken the film was made in English almost neutralize the overall atmosphere however waiting for the final punch scene i very worth the patience it s not the best film that Polanski made yet ha many good part it show the hand and the style of the director and was a significant step in the building of hi career	positive

This movie couldn't decide which one it wanted to be, so it ended up being a joke on itself.<br /><br />It seems to have been liberally copied from movies like Bride and Prejudice and Bollywood Calling, and what a sloppy, lazy job at that. How can Bollywood ever be weaned off of its determination to stick to overused, well-trodden scripts? Is there no one who can bring to the screen the millions of real, fascinating stories that surely exist and transpire in the land of a billion people?

r28662	No movie could ever do justice to Faulkner's command of the English language. but they did a pretty good job here. Lucas Beauchamp is exactly the way I pictured him in the book, as is Chick. What the movie couldn't really go into was how Beauchamp wasn't liked by the Negro people either, because he was equally as stubborn. Not that it is a bad thing, but from my take on the book that was his attitude toward the world (yet, I got the feeling it was white society's racism that started it and it spilled over into Negro society, until that became his attitude toward everyone).<br /><br />the best part of the movie is that you get to see Yoknapatawpha county (actually, Oxford, Mississippi) exactly as Faulkner wrote about it (the film was made when Faulkner was alive and writing).

r40839	This movie is about basically human relations, and the interaction between them. The main character is an old lady who at the twilight of her life starts a journey to her past, doing an analysis of how she lived her life. This journey is precipitated because of the sons economic crisis and his intentions to put her in a nursing home. It is a very honest look to some issues that we all ask ourselves at some point in life, and there is plenty of secondary ideas to discuss in this movie such as family legacy, real love, marriage or destiny. although this type of movie melodramas are nothing new, this one can be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas. There is a good performance by the actors and the characters are very believable, but because of the time some characters are maybe not fully developed.

r47506	"The comment by ""eliz7212-1"" hits the proverbial ""nail on the head"" for this turkey of a program. But it is a hoot to watch William Shatner ""cavort"" and ""dance"" (yes, the "" "" marks on the word dance are necessary for what Bill does). This show would be a great skit on SNL or MAD TV - and it does rate a few stars for one viewing, or so, to see Shatner, who seems to have taken ""camp"" to new heights - whether in a role or as himself. But the guy is funny.<br /><br />The girls who are in the cubicle areas with the game data scrolls, will be pretty much out-of-luck when this turkey is canceled - unless there is a revival of the whiskey-a-go-go genre, with a resurrected demand for shapely young women to dance in elevated cages once more.<br /><br />I watched the first contestant, who was annoying, and literally ""dumber than a :post,"" yet through sheer luck, walked away with a quarter mil or so. The second contestant, somewhat more intelligent, but who'd be lucky to gain $1,000 on Jeopardy!, got zonked by the card which requires answering a special question - which he didn't know, and thereby left with zilch.<br /><br />This plethora of game shows, which dangle, and sometimes award, large sums to everyday individuals, are admittedly a cheap effort, overall, to attempt to woo viewers. Even if the host is well-compensated, and they give away six figures in an average episode, I suppose that the revenue versus costs can be favorable - since you don't have a sitcom cast where several stars are getting six or seven figures, per episode, with some big residual deals as well.<br /><br />But I suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long.

And it's a not very good documentary either American MOVIE seems to have confused some people into thinking this is a spoof documentary ( "" Mockumentary ) and even some newspaper TV listings described it as such . I'll not laugh out loud at that because it's easy to mistake this documentary as one big wind up ala THIS IS SPINAL TAP <br /><br />What seems to have caused the confusion is that the documentary centres around budding film maker Mark Borchardt who is .... How can I put it ? Rather self deluded ? Yes but that's not necessarily a bad thing since if we had no dreams we'd all still be living in caves and the fact that Mark is obsessed with horror movies is not to be taken as a criticism since both Sam Raimi ( Yes that one ) and Peter Jackson ( yes that one ) both started out doing low budget horror comedies so again it's not a criticism . No it's just that Mark Borchardt ( yes that one ) is a parody of American trailer trash <br /><br />Remember in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY Ben Stiller gives a lift to a dodgy hitch hiker ( "" Come into my office because you're f***in' fired "" ) ? Well that's who Mark resembles along with most of Jerry Springer's guests so it's very easy to see why some people thought this wasn't a real documentary .

r13270	"Anyone who knows me even remotely can tell you that I love bad movies almost as much as I love great ones, and I can honestly say that I have finally seen one of the all-time legendary bad movies: the almost indescribable mess that is MYRA BRECKINRIDGE. An adaptation of Gore Vidal's best-selling book (he later disowned this film version), the star-studded MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is truly a movie so bad that it remains bizarrely entertaining from beginning to end. The X-rated movie about sex change operations and Hollywood was an absolute catastrophe at the box office and was literally booed off the screen by both critics and audiences at the time of it's release. Not surprisingly, the film went on to gain a near-legendary cult status among lovers of bad cinema, and I was actually quite excited to finally see for the first time.<br /><br />Director Michael Sarne (who only had two other previous directing credits to his name at the time), took a lot of flack for the finished film, and, in honesty, it really does not look like he had a clue about what he was trying to achieve. The film is often incoherent, with entire sequences edited together in such a half-hazzard manner that many scenes become nearly incomprehensible. Also irritating is the gimmick of using archival footage from the Fox film vaults and splicing it into the picture at regular intervals. This means that there is archival footage of past film stars such as Judy Garland and Shirley Temple laced into newly-film scenes of often lewd sexual acts, and the process just doesn't work as intended (this also caused a minor uproar, as actors such as Temple and Loretta Young sued the studio for using their image without permission).<br /><br />Perhaps Sarne is not the only one to blame, however, as the film's screenplay and casting will also make many viewers shake their heads in disbelief. For instance, this film will ask you to believe that the scrawny film critic Rex Reed (in his first and last major film role) could have a sex change operation and emerge as the gorgeous sex goddess Raquel Welch?! The film becomes further hard to follow when Welch as Myra attempts to take over a film school from her sleazy uncle (played by legendary film director John Huston), seduce a nubile female film student (Farrah Fawcett), and teach the school's resident bad boy (Roger Herren) a lesson by raping him with a strap-on dildo. Did everyone follow that? <br /><br />And it gets even better (or worse, depending upon your perspective)! I have yet to mention the film's top-billed star: the legendary screen sex symbol of the nineteen-thirties, Mae West! Ms. West was 77 year old when she appeared in this film (she had been retired for 26 years), and apparently she still considered herself to be a formidable sex symbol as she plays an upscale talent agent who has hunky men (including a young Tom Selleck) throwing themselves at her. As if this weren't bad enough, the tone-deaf West actually performs two newly-written songs about halfway through the film, and I think that I might have endured permanent brain damage from listening to them! <br /><br />Naturally, none of this even closely resembles anything that any person of reasonable taste would describe as ""good,"" but I would give MYRA BRECKINRIDGE a 4 out of 10 because it was always morbidly entertaining even when I had no idea what in the hell was supposed to be going on. Also, most of the cast tries really hard. Raquel, in particular, appears so hell-bent in turning her poorly-written part into something meaningful that she single-handedly succeeds in making the movie worth watching. If she had only been working with a decent screenplay and capable director then she might have finally received some respect form critics.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is also fine. The endearingly over-the-top John Huston (who really should have been directing the picture) has some funny moments, Rex Reed isn't bad for a non-actor, and Farrah Fawcett is pleasantly fresh-faced and likable. Roger Herren is also fine, but he never appeared in another movie again after this (I guess he just couldn't live down being the guy who was rapped by Raquel Welch). And as anyone could guess from the description above, Mae West was totally out of her mind when she agreed to do this movie - but that's part of what makes it fun for those of us who love bad cinema."	anyone who know me even remote can tell you that i love bad movie almost a much a i love great one and i can honest say that i have final seen one of the all time legendary bad movie the almost describable mess that i Myra an adaptation of gore Vidal s best sell book he late own this film version the star studded Myra i truly a movie so bad that it remain bizarre entertaining from beginning to end the x rated movie about sex change operate and Hollywood was an absolute catastrophe at the box office and was literal boo off the screen by both critic and audience at the time of it s release not surprising the film went on to gain a near legendary cult status among love of bad cinema and i was actual quite excited to final see for the first time director Michael who on had two other previous direct credit to hi name at the time took a lot of flack for the finished film and in honesty it real does not look like he had a clue about what he was trying to achieve the film i often coherent with entire sequence edited together in such a half manner that many scene become near comprehensible also irritating i the gimmick of use archival footage from the fox film vault and splice it to the picture at regular interval this mean that there i archival footage of past film star such a Judy garland and Shirley temple lace to new film scene of often lewd sexual act and the process just t work a intended this also cause a minor uproar a actor such a temple and Loretta young sue the studio for use their image without permission perhaps i not the on one to blame however a the film s screenplay and casting will also make many view shake their head in belief for instance this film will ask you to believe that the scrawny film critic Rex ed in hi first and last major film role could have a sex change operation and emerge a the gorgeous sex goddess Raquel the film become further hard to follow when a Myra attempt to take over a film school from h sleazy uncle play by legendary film director john Huston seduce a nubile female film student and teach the school s resident bad boy roger a lesson by rap him with a strap on dildo did everyone follow that and it get even better or worse pend upon your perspective i have yet to mention the film s top bill star the legendary screen sex symbol of the nineteen thirty Mae west m west was year old when she appear in this film she had been tire for year and apparent she still considered herself to be a formidable sex symbol a she play an upscale talent agent who ha hunky men include a young tom throw themselves at h a if this t bad enough the tone deaf west actual perform two new written song about halfway through the film and i think that i might have endure permanent brain damage from listen to them natural none of this even close resemble anything that any person of reasonable taste would describe a good but i would give Myra a 4 out of because it was always morbid entertaining even when i had no idea what in the hell was supposed to be going on also most of the cast try real hard Raquel in particular appear so hell bent in turning h poor written part to something meaningful that she single succeed in making the movie worth watch if she had on been work with a decent screenplay and capable director then she might have final receive some respect form critic the rest of the cast i also fine the endearing over the top john Huston who real should have been direct the picture ha some funny moment Rex ed t bad for a non actor and i pleasant fresh face and likable roger i also fine but he never appear in another movie again aft this i guess he just t live down being the guy who was rapped by Raquel and a anyone could guess from the description above Mae west was total out of h mind when she agree to do this movie but that s part of what make it fun for those of u who love bad cinema	negative
r27488	"This film gives new meaning to the term ""uneven"", giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by an awkwardly realized plot that relies on a few well-placed stingers to deliver the majority of the thrills.<br /><br />The plot concerns a group of men who harbor a secret that has caused a curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female apparation that causes death. She also may be seducing their sons.<br /><br />It is quite a spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors together in one film, but unfortunately they're not very convincing, particularly the scene where Melvyn Douglas goes off the deep end begging the others to listen to him. It's no shock then that the actors who play these same characters in their youth are terrible, especially the giggling Ricky. They deliver the worst ""gee-aren't-we-all-drunk"" scene I've ever watched.<br /><br />The movie has a few saving graces, namely Dick Smith's great ghost makeups (however misplaced they are in this film), and Alice Krige's fascinating performance as Alma/Eva. I've never read the novel that this film was taken from, but I intend to after reading some of the other reviews on this page. You don't have to have read the book, however, to realize that this is only a shadow of the original tale. There is a good story here, but it seems lost somewhere, amid exposition that shows the men having nightmares over and over again and making unsubtle references to the secret they all share. <br /><br />As it stands, it appears as if there was about half an hour of footage removed from this print, particularly near the climax. After all...how is it that Fred Astaire manages to mount an excavation of the pond so quickly? What did Gregory Bate and the kid have to do with Eva? And while we're at it...what the hell was she, anyway? Why did letting her out of the car cause the apparition to disappear? If it was an apparition, how could it have sex with two men and have them not know?<br /><br />These and other questions will never be answered, at least not by this film.

r44432	"How to take Charles Darwin's fantastic intellectual journey and turn it into a chick flick. His pivotal and seminal ideas and their radical influence on Western thought and capitalist society are untouched except for two brief scenes, in one of which it is claimed he is ""killing God""; pure demagoguery to make the movie emotional. And the rest of the movie buckles to that purpose: it consists entirely of melodramatic and long family scenes with overloud music at which one is beholden to cry. Anyone who actually read ""Origin Of Species"" would be vividly aware that there was no breach with God in any of Darwin's work; to the contrary, there was an increased awe and respect, and a revolutionary new way of looking at things. A good movie about Darwin could be educational, thoughtful, and deeply inspiring, even in a religious sense - but that would contradict the soap-opera intentions of this flick. This is a flick that is designed to make people wail in contrived sympathy and then feel transformed although unable to understand why; it makes fast use of Darwin's great name only as marketing clout, as one would drop a famous name at a party to create an impression. Sad that the sets and costumes are so good: production values, except for the writing, were obviously high. See it if you want to weep, for the loss of intelligence in American literature."	how to take Charles Darwin s fantastic intellectual journey and turn it to a chick flick hi pivotal and seminal idea and their radical influence on western thought and capitalist society are touched except for two brief scene in one of which it i claimed he i killing god pure demagoguery to make the movie emotional and the rest of the movie buckle to that purpose it consist entire of melodramatic and long family scene with music at which one i behold to cry anyone who actual read origin of species would be vivid aware that there was no breach with god in any of Darwin s work to the contrary there was an crease awe and respect and a revolutionary new way of look at the a good movie about Darwin could be educational thoughtful and deep inspiring even in a religious sense but that would contradict the soap opera intention of this flick this i a flick that i sign to make people wail in contrive sympathy and then feel transform although able to understand why it make fast use of Darwin s great name on a marketing clout a one would drop a famous name at a party to create an impression sad that the set and costume are so good production value except for the writing were obvious high see it if you want to weep for the loss of intelligence in American literature	negative

r32659	"There have been numerous productions that tell of the development of the atomic bomb. The Robert Taylor film ABOVE AND BEYOND (flag waving interservice propaganda really; if you believe this one you think that the Army Air Corps, in the person of Paul W. Tibbits, ran the entire show!), the NBC produced ENOLA GAY (probably A LOT closer to the mark), and the BBC-TV series, OPPENHEIMER, with Sam Waterston in the title role.<br /><br />FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes the same approach that the BBC series did but widens it; it avoids the ""Gee Whiz"" technology of the Manhattan Project and focuses on human aspects; the personalities involved in the work. Instead of focusing on Oppie, it covers a wide swath of mythical but pretty typical people who were part of it.<br /><br />With reservations, Dwight Schultz did a good job as Oppie, presenting a dreamy, Ivory Tower academic who struggles to relate his contributions as a physicist to his inclinations to view the world in a wider social and moral context... only to have that struggle won by an overriding lust for personal power and glory. In THE DAY AFTER TRINITY it was made clear that Oppenheimer viewed himself as a ""superior being"" by virtue of his vast, wide ranging intellectual prowess. In the end that was Robert Oppenheimer's downfall; he saw himself as a sort of ""Philosopher/King"", a moral and intellectual superior who could (and rightfully SHOULD) ""wisely"" prescribe what was best for the rest of the world re. nuclear weapons development and deployment. <br /><br />Unfortunately, wisdom doesn't dictate the actions of nations or direction of events on a global scale. Wisdom doesn't bestow temporal power. When it tries to exercise such nonexistent power (as Oppie found when he opposed the development of ""The Super"", the hydrogen bomb), wisdom is ignored and banished by those who REALLY have the power.<br /><br />I found myself faulting Schultz character in one way; his Oppie exposes himself TOO closely and personally to the Manhattan Project, despite the doubts and fears that tore at his intellectual basis. The real Oppenheimer would have had to take a different approach; at the beginning he would have had to come to the firm resolution that the project would result in ultimate good. The ugliness it produced along the way would be an incidental price that must be paid to attain that ultimate good, and it must be ignored... at least until the end of the project when there was leisure to assess the gains and losses. Oppie clearly did that, and it resulted in his controversial postwar statements to the effect that science had now known sin, and that was a knowledge it could never lose. <br /><br />While the project went on, such considerations HAD to be pushed aside if he was to maintain his sanity.<br /><br />Because of this ambiguity, Schultz character comes off as a weak, frightened little boy who could NEVER have served as ""Coordinator of Rapid Rupture"", as Oppenheimer unofficially dubbed his post.<br /><br />Paul Newman's take on Gen. Leslie R. Groves is fascinating, and a bravura performance, if possibly a LITTLE BIT over the top.<br /><br />Groves was a civil engineer by training, but first and foremost he was a SOLDIER, and a general to boot! He's accustomed to DEMANDING that things go HIS way... intensely driven, a foul mouthed, spoiled child who has tantrums at the drop of a hat, who reveres his country and isn't too proud to fall on his knees and pray. In other words, very much like REAL (ie, NON civil engineer) soldiers, aka George Patton! Grove's MISSION not only comes first, it is his ONLY consideration... feelings and egos be damned, except for his OWN, of course! <br /><br />Groves couldn't admit it, but he knew full well that he NEEDED Oppenheimer; military rank meant NOTHING in the world of theoretical physicists. Oppie was a necessary interface between the two worlds he had to straddle.<br /><br />Again... I have to fault the script on this, and for the same reason.<br /><br />In reality, Groves already OWNED Oppie; if he didn't, Oppie would never have been chosen for the post in the first place. History tells of MANY cases where other scientists, some as stellar as Oppenheimer, simply walked away from Groves recruitment efforts. At one point Groves was so desperate that he proposed DRAFTING the physicists he needed!<br /><br />Groves attempts in the film to maneuver and control Oppie were UNNECESSARY... they only exist here as a dramatic device which indeed helps make the atmosphere of the film quite ugly.<br /><br />Kusak's ""Michael Merriman"" is a composite of several real characters, but they're from a different time frame. Several research accidents similar to the one depicted happened in POSTWAR weapons research. <br /><br />Merriman's radiation overdose creates another ugliness in the film, but one which is, IMHO, necessary, and pretty accurate. People with weak stomachs will have a hard time handling the hospital sequences; they're all TOO real.<br /><br />The main idea that comes across, but not strongly enough IMHO, is the big truth of the Los Alamos experience. The scientists who signed on were young, idealistic and naive as well as talented. Most were on their first excursion out of the shelter of the campus. To them the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to practice experimental physics on a large scale without the constraints of budgets or ""excessive"" bureaucratic oversight. <br /><br />It was not only their brilliance, but their youthful exuberance that produced the atomic bomb. <br /><br />There's plenty here to make the thoughtful viewer intensely uncomfortable about this movie. Just the same, if you filter out the Hollywood BS (there isn't that much of it really), this is probably a pretty accurate view of the inside of Manhattan Project."	there have been numerous production

The end result of the trials and tribulations at the Ponderosa Ranch, as demonstrated in this series, sparked a realization that Americans are now auspiciously enjoying the fruits of the Cartwright's painstaking labor!!<br /><br />The T.V. Show ""Bonanza"" was popular for so many different reasons, mostly on account of the fact that the late fifties and early sixties had not yet established the divisiveness of two different cultural mindsets which was ready to surface with our nation! The unification of ideologies in the United States which prevailed during the debut of ""Bonanza"" was a big reason for the show's success!! In the show's later years, ""Bonanza"" had established a firmly entrenched core market television audience!! The cast to ""Bonanza"" became famous, and the wholesome entertainment of ""Bonanza"" encompassed a camaraderie for the All-American idealist!!

r48926	Personally I've watched it because of Lea Thompson's appearance and I didn't really expect to enjoy the movie as such, but surprisingly I kept watching it until the end.<br /><br />Let's face it - it just one of the saga-like stories and isn't particularly original or entertaining, but strangely it just keeps you by the TV. My opinion about Will of Their Own would be much better if there wouldn't be one point that I just don't get.<br /><br />There is lovely and really touchy scene in which Lea Thompson's character is running on the street holding baby in her arms, the snow is falling, she is cold, scared, and has no place to stay, she doesn't know what to do next. And then about 10-12 years later, when things are better for her, she just leaves the same kid without any warning to take up the career she was dreaming about.<br /><br />I just don't get it - I don't see how is it possible that she would do such thing, it was the opposite action to all that she done so far in her life when all that she was doing was aimed on that child survival. After this character flip I just couldn't enjoy rest of the movie.	personal i watch it because of lea Thompson s appearance and i t real expect to enjoy the movie a such but surprising i kept watch it until the end let s face it it just one of the saga like story and t particular original or entertaining but strange it just keep you by the TV my opinion about will of their own would be much better if there t be one point that i just don t get there i lovely and real touchy scene in which lea Thompson s character i running on the street holding baby in h arm the snow i fall she i cold scar and ha no place to stay she t know what to do next and then about year late when the are better for h she just leave the same kid without any warning to take up the career she was dream about i just don t get it i don t see how i it possible that she would do such thing it was the opposite action to all that she done so far in h life when all that she was doing was aim on that child survival aft this character flip i just t enjoy rest of the movie	negative

And how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn't gotten hers yet.

r12935	"Like ""My Sassy Girl"", this movie is based on a true story posted from the internet, but that's where the similarities end. The story is generally about this rebellious guy named Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Woo) who is still trying to finish high school, whose parents hire a tutor named Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), a woman who comes from a poor background, but happens to be the same age as him. Add to that some obstacles, martial arts (thugs are always after Ji-Hoon for revenge), a scorned, thuggish love-sick girl who is after him, his proclivity for ditching the lessons, and you generally can guess the whole story. Did I mention it's a romantic comedy? This movie has some good fight scenes, great visual humor and a lot of spunk, thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, that bring a lot of energy to the story. The romantic elements also work because of that reason. And, I must say, I'd want a girlfriend more like Kim Ha Nuel than that girl from ""My Sassy Girl"" (personality-wise, at least). She has some spunk, but it's more on the cute, sweet, good-hearted way. Characters are already mostly likable (so one might say it had less of a hill to climb than ""My Sassy Girl""--an obstacle that worked for that movie to its credit), and the movie is quite clever and interesting most of the way. The story kind of sags, though, about 2/3 of the way (where it sort of treads on familiar, standard fare, where nothing really interesting happens), but near the end, it picks up a bit again. Overall, a fun, cute movie. 8/10"	like my sassy girl this movie i base on a true story post from the internet but that s where the similarity end the story i general about this rebellious guy named sang woo who i still trying to finish high school whose parent hire a tutor named wan Kim ha a woman who come from a poor background but happen to be the same age a him add to that some obstacle martial art thug are always aft for revenge a scorn thuggish love sick girl who i aft him hi proclivity for ditch the lesson and you general can guess the whole story did i mention it s a romantic comedy this movie ha some good fight scene great visual humor and a lot of spunk thank to the good chemistry between Kim ha and sang woo that bring a lot of energy to the story the romantic element also work because of that reason and i must say i d want a girlfriend more like Kim ha than that girl from my sassy girl personality wise at least she ha some spunk but it s more on the cute sweet good way character are already most likable so one might say it had less of a hill to climb than my sassy girl an obstacle that work for that movie to it credit and the movie i quite clever and interesting most of the way the story kind of sag though about 2 3 of the way where it sort of tread on familiar standard fare where nothing real interesting happen but near the end it pick up a bit again overall a fun cute movie 8	positive
r12329	At the name of Pinter, every knee shall bow - especially after his Nobel Literature Prize acceptance speech which did little more than regurgitate canned, by-the-numbers, sixth-form anti-Americanism. But this is even worse; not only is it a tour-de-force of talentlessness, a superb example of how to get away with coasting on your decades-old reputation, but it also represents the butchery of a superb piece. The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind. Yes, it was a theatrical confection, and it is easy to see how it's central plot device would work better on the stage than the screen, but it still worked terrifically well. This is a Michael Caine vanity piece, but let's face it, Caine is no Olivier. Not only can he not fill Larry's shoes, he couldn't even fill his bathroom slippers. The appropriately-named Caine is, after all, a distinctly average actor, whose only real recommendation, like so many British actors, is their longevity in the business. He was a good Harry Palmer, excellent in Get Carter, but that's yer lot, mate! Give this a very wide berth and stick to the superb original. This is more of a half-pinter.	at the name of Pinter every knee shall bow especial aft hi Nobel literature prize acceptance speech which did little more than regurgitate canned by the number sixth form anti Americanism but this i even worse not on i it a tour force of a superb example of how to get away with coast on your decade old reputation but it also represent the butchery of a superb piece the original sleuth was a masterpiece of it kind yes it was a theatrical confection and it i easy to see how it s central plot vice would work better on the stage than the screen but it still work terrifically well this i a Michael vanity piece but let s face it i no Olivier not on can he not fill Larry s shoe he t even fill hi bathroom slipper the appropriate named i aft all a distinct average actor whose on real commendation like so many British actor i their longevity in the business he was a good harry Palmer excellent in get carter but that s ye lot mate give this a very wide berth and stick to the superb original this i more of a half	negative

I was reminded of the early work of Sam Raimi. Yes it is rough, but has good energy and plenty of fun. The acting ranges from the very good in Scott Ironside and Shawn Paul Hasser, to the not so good in some of the lesser parts. Is it a cult movie? Well it grew on me. First time I liked it but by the 3rd viewing I was loving it. The movie is probably a 7 out of 10 but I'm giving it 8 for sheer cheek. Anyone who can pull this off for 8 grand is worth watching.

r893	"A good ol' boy film is almost required to have moonshine, car chases, a storyline that has a vague resemblance to ""plot"" and at least one very pretty country gal, barefoot with short shorts and a low top. The pretty gal is here (dressed in designer jeans)-- but the redneck prerequisites stop there. Jimmy Dean is a natural as a sausage spokesman but as a tough guy former sheriff, he comes up way short. Big John is big, but he isn't convincing with the ""bad"" part of his moniker. Bug-eyed Jack Elam is a hoot as always and Bo Hopkins has been playing this same part for decades; Ned Beatty also does his part in a small role... but there is no STORY. It smells more like an episode of In The Heat Of The Night than a feature film. Cornball cornpone with easily predictable sentiment.

I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked. I think that only made the movie more realistic.

r1460	"The influence of Hal Hartley in Adrienne Shelly's ""I'll Take You There"" is not overt, but clearly has ties to his work (Shelly has acted in two of Hartley's films). Not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative, but the hyper-stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light. Though this film is not ironic on the whole (thank God), the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss. With beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies, ""I'll See You There"" is a great indie-film that doesn't stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion.<br /><br />The film begins with Bill's life falling to pieces. Not only has he sold his best friend Ray a beautiful country home, but his wife Rose has left him in order to join Ray in the retreat. All washed up, Bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister Lucy (played by the director Adrienne Shelly) brings him all kinds of surprises: a self-help book and a ""date"" for her traumatized brother.<br /><br />The unwilling Bill tries to refuse, but the sudden appearance of Bernice at his door leaves him no choice. No doubt Bernice's initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to ""rebound"" with her. However, her pseudo-hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date. And Bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him, forcing herself upon him. To what end, we are not aware... except for maybe the fact that she is psycho. (And who better to play the psycho than Ally Sheedy?)<br /><br />Aware that Bill desperately wants to see Rose, Bernice offers her car, but on the condition that he take her somewhere first. On the way, she proceeds to hold Bill prisoner with his own gun (a Pinkerton Detective, no less). An imbroglio of angst, resentment, redemption, passion and violence ensue as Bill and Bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of Ray and Rose... of course, with a few stops along the way."	the influence of Hal in Adrienne Shelly s i ll take you there i not overt but clear ha tie to hi work Shelly ha act in two of s film not on does h film exhibit a very tight narrative but the hype stylize and extreme character strange render human emotion in a very real light though this film i not ironic on the whole thank god the small and subtle irony that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss with beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventy i ll see you there i a great indie film that t stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woe of love and the reality of human emotion the film begin with bill s life fall to piece not on ha he sold hi best friend ray a beautiful country home but hi wife rose ha left him in order to join ray in the treat all washed up bill wallow in hi own gloom and doom until hi sister Lucy play by the director Adrienne Shelly bring him all kinds of surprise a self help book and a date for h traumatize brother the willing bill try to fuse but the sudden appearance of Bernice at hi door leave him no choice no doubt Bernice s initial superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from hi ability to bound with h however h pseudo hippie quality annoy him so much that he lash at h on their first date and Bernice i so traumatize by hi derogatory mark that she attach herself to him force herself upon him to what end we are not aware except for maybe the fact that she i psycho and who better to play the psycho than ally aware that bill desperate want to see rose Bernice off h car but on the condition that he take h somewhere first on the way she proceeds to hold bill prisoner with hi own gun a Pinkerton detective no less an imbroglio of angst resentment redemption passion and violence ensue a bill and Bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of ray and rose of course with a few stop along the way	positive

Probably the most impressive fighting sequence was at the beginning when ninja killed about 20 people, that was one of the most impressive ninja fighting sequences I've ever seen. Another good fighting sequence was at a cops funeral where the ninja provide more people to bury. The last fight was also very impressive. Also I kinda liked the soundtrack of this movie.

r45799	"First and foremost I wish to aim a big & mean middle-finger towards the Troma DVD-distribution crew, who were actually stupid enough to reveal the identity of this movie's pivot killer on the back of the cover! The synopsis just randomly mentions who's the person responsible for the massacre on graduation day, for Christ's sake! I don't care how terrible or how predictable an 80's slasher can be; just mentioning who did it ruins the whole point! So, a word of advise in case you also purchase the Troma double-feature containing ""Graduation Day"" and ""Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell"", do not  repeat DO NOT  turn the box around and read the back! Watching the film is already a painful experience, but reading the back would really spoil everything.<br /><br />Now, as for the actual the actual movie Oh boy! Personally I'm a fan of the cinematic 'work' of Herb Freed. Well actually, I don't really know whether I should admire himor pity him! All Herb's films are pretty bad & amateurish, but at the same time you can tell his direction is spirited and full of good intentions! Unlike with ""Haunts"" and ""Beyond Evil"", he followed a contemporary popular genre trend and tried to cash in on the typical high-school slasher films. Just to offer a minimum of originality, all the victims in ""Graduation Day"" are promising athletes and members of the same track of coach George Michaels (awesome name! I guess Herb Freed is a fan of ""Wham!""). During the opening credits, we witness how a young girl dramatically dies on the field, moments after winning a 30 seconds running race. The debate of whether or not her coach and fellow track team-members weren't pushing her physical limits too much is raised, but one particular individual goes one step further and begins to sadistically kill everyone he/she considers responsible for Laura's death. What a demented little movie! The script must be one of the most incoherent ones I ever beheld, with loads of red herrings and sub plots that go absolutely nowhere and death sequences that are almost too cheesy for words! There's a bloke impaled by a football attached to a javelin, others are decapitated with an absurdly big sword and the unluckiest bastard of them all even falls to his death on a disguised bed of spikes! Herb concentrates on the ingeniousness & the fast pacing of the killings so much that he totally forgets about the sub plots he introduced earlier in the film! For example, Laura's sister returns home from her military training and seemly starts an investigation regarding the circumstances of her death. Halfway through the movie, however, her character hardly appears in the movie anymore. Also, the girls' stepfather is referred to as a violent drunkard but this interesting given immediately gets ignored as well. Instead of carefully mounted suspense and misleading red herrings, we're served disco-dancing & roller-skating sequences and  of course  numerous images of unattractive 80's chicks stripping their tops off. Despite being really bad, ""Graduation Day"" could count on a respectable cast! Christopher George (""Grizzly"", ""City of the Living Dead"") greatly stars as the demanding coach, Carmen Argenziano (""When a Stranger Calls"", ""The Accused"") briefly appears as a police detective investigating the rising number of missing teenagers and Michael Pataki (""Dead & Buried"", ""Dracula's Dog"") has a very amusing part as the school's stressed out principal. The teenage beauties on duty include Linnea Quigley and Vanna White. Heck, for some horror fans, the presence of these two ladies is enough reason already to count ""Graduation Day"" among the most quintessential slashers of the early 80's.

This movie will probably open your eyes as to how strongly the American way of life is dependent on the ""abundance of cheap oil"" - a term used throughout the film. A lot of the topics are plain common sense, and they don't go into a huge amount of depth about any of them. But you've probably never put all the pieces together like this movie does. The interviews with the authors and energy experts are all very interesting. I don't think this film is meant to scare people. It's merely meant to inform people about what to expect in the years ahead, and maybe to encourage you to think twice about commuting 100miles to work and leaving your lights on all day long.<br /><br />After watching this film I was no longer able to look at the cars and buses zooming by quite the same.

r24194	I'm not sure how this could have been better, so I gave it a 10. The acting was excellent - the main woman was so HOT - the chap who played Darwyn was a smouldering, pensive character who showed the inner turmoil he was suffering (the truck driver's death is one example)excellently. The storyline was believable and the series length was just about right (i.e. I love Lost, but will it ever end?). As a Brit i tend to think of Yanks as gung ho. The LAPD were in their ill advised attempts to arrest him, but the other agencies were portrayed positively. My main thought about programmes like this (and the also excellent 24) is - could it happen? Would it happen? Is it happening now? Possibly, probably.<br /><br />I hope they do another series, but after reading some of the previous comments, it would appear not.<br /><br />To summarise - If you haven't seen it, make sure you do.	i m not sure how this could have been better so i gave it a the acting was excellent the main woman was so hot the chap who play was a pensive character who show the inn turmoil he was suffering the truck driver s death i one example excellent the was believable and the series length was just about right i e i love lost but will it ever end a a Brit i tend to think of yank a ho the were in their ill advised attempt to arrest him but the other agency were portray positive my main thought about like this and the also excellent i could it happen would it happen i it happening now possibly probably i hope they do another series but aft reading some of the previous comment it would appear not to if you haven t seen it make sure you do	positive
r7401	Ahh, the dull t.v. shows and pilots that were slammed together in the 70's to make equally dull t.v. movies! Some examples would be Riding With Death(the most hysterically cheesy of the lot), Stranded in Space(confusing and uninteresting), San Francisco International(horribly dull and unbelievably confusing), and this turgid bit of Quinn Martin glamor. <br /><br />Shot in Hawaii(although you wouldn't know it from the outside shots), it's apparently a failed pilot for a lame spy show. The real problem is that you don;'t like most of the characters, including the drab main character Diamond Head, who seemed half asleep for the entire movie; his boss 'Aunt Mary', who had a really weird delivery of his lines and shellacked white hair as well as the a tan that looked like it had been stuccoed on; Diamnd Head's girlfriend/fellow agent(hell, I can't even remember her name) a skinny, wooden woman with a flat way of speaking that is just not sexy or interesting; and the singing sidekick Zulu(again, i can't remember his character's name)who wasn't bad in small doses. The most interesting person in the whole production was Ian McShane, who sucked as a bad guy but still proved his acting chops. Alothugh the make-up jobs this so-called 'chameleon' used to disguise himself were just laughable. I have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab that caused him to dress as a South American Dictator cum American General. Nor do I care.

In the past several years, I had stopped watching contemporary Hindi movies and reverted to watching the classics (Teesri Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay, etc.) But this movie changed everything. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I found it not only to be moving but also found it to be very educational for someone who is a first generation Indian woman growing up in America. It helped me to understand my own family history, which was always something very abstract to me. But, to ""see"" it, feel it and understand it helped me to sympathize with the generations before me and the struggle that Indian people endured. The film helped to put many things into perspective for me, especially considering the current world events. I never thought that a movie could change the way I think like this before... it did.

r23070	"What a dog of a movie. Noni Hazelhurst's performance is quite good, but it sits amidst a jungle of abhorrent scriptwriting, mediocre direction and wooden acting from the bulk of the cast. Many of the characters are woefully miscast, particularly the ever overrated Colin Friels.<br /><br />Very little works in this pretentious garbage. Much of the ""character development"" is done through a silly, angst-ridden voice over and frequently completely contradicts the behaviour of characters on-screen. In fact, it's hard to even figure out who the voice overs are talking about because they describe such different characters to who we see on screen! How are we meant to know Colin Friels (Javo) is meant to be an erratic, violent and unreliable junkie? One of these silly voice overs tells us. For crying out loud, the nature of his character is half the point of the movie and the only thing that lets us know is a flippin' voice over! The real killer is the characters. Everything about them. Their clothes are perfectly maintained and look fresh from the rack, despite the fact we are constantly reminded they are meant to be artsy paupers. They are all absurdly well-spoken for ""junkies"". None seem to have any real comprehension of life on the skids or on smack and yet this is meant to be the case with most of them.<br /><br />Monkey Grip deserves no more attention than a weekday TV movie matinée. Crud like this, perfectly well shot and technically presented, but a cliché-driven angsty drama that shoots so wide of being plausible and meanders about for hours without really going anywhere.

r23227	This was a silly movie with a predictable storyline and dreadful acting!! Willy Nelson was as stiff as his braids. The movie just seemed like a very long advert for the bright red lipstick that Jessica Simpson wore - especially as there were so many close-ups on her face. The premise was not amusing and as I said - soooooooo predictable. Whatever money was spent on making this movie was a shameful waste. Any allusions to other old Marilyn Monroe movies did not enhance the viewing of Blonde Ambition at all. It was also so unbelievable - Jessica Simpson being able to step into an executive secretary position at the drop of a hat - that was laughable!!!	this was a silly movie with a predictable and dreadful acting willy nelson was a stiff a hi braid the movie just seem like a very long advert for the bright red lipstick that Jessica Simpson wore especial a there were so many close up on h face the premise was not amusing and a i said predictable whatever money was spent on making this movie was a shameful waste any allusion to other old Marilyn Monroe movie did not enhance the viewing of blonde ambition at all it was also so believable Jessica Simpson being able to step to an executive secretary position at the drop of a hat that was laugh	negative

I saw on release in the early '70's, was lucky enough to catch it via American Cinematheque's preservation efforts, and it still has some tangible moments that stayed with me for thirty years.<br /><br />No reason to repeat rwint's accurate comments here. As a come-out Director soon after the soaring success of Five Easy Pieces, Jack N has been said to have managed the low budget effort as best as possible, and it certainly shows in the wandering and meandering that could have used some re-cutting. But it's also a memorable icon for it's time: the all very intense clashes of late 60's college sports, student movements, sexual revolution, and more. <br /><br />Why see this film? It was probably a ground breaker in some scenes: the frisky male bonding in the after-game showers; Karen Black's scene with Tepper in the car will catch you a little off guard - but it's the first use of a word I hadn't witnessed in film before; and the casual and unexpected use of nudity overall. There are probably others I'm omitting.<br /><br />Look for a nice surprise of a young Cindy Williams in one of her first films; a thin David Ogend Stiers; Mike Warren fresh out of his powder-blue UCLA uniform and readying for a dark-blue TV uniform; Robert Towne - Actor; and a whole lot of folks simply playing themselves.<br /><br />Now: any connection between Harry Gittes last name, Robert Towne, and a certain character in Chinatown and the Two Jakes?<br /><br />It gets a ""7"" based on Karen Black.

r27844	I watched the film recently and it poorly resembles the book is based on. I blame this on poor screenplay and direction. Some parts were forcibly introduced (the gay rape scene) for no apparent reason. I actually read the book after watching the movie and some 20 years or so after reading it for the first time. I found it hard to read and somewhat clumsy. Too many disparate ideas introduced for no benefit at all... other than sensational parts for the time. As it covers stuff that was deemed 'sensitive', to say the least, during communism, I can see the fascination it produced at the time. That isn't the case anymore though or maybe I see things differently now or a bit of both. The film tries too much to cover many aspects from the book, the result being a concoction of scenes that may make some sense to someone who read the book. Even so this is a film that is difficult to watch and maybe should have never been made.	i watch the film recent and it poor resemble the book i base on i blame this on poor screenplay and direction some part were forcibly introduce the gay rape scene for no apparent reason i actual read the book aft watch the movie and some year or so aft reading it for the first time i found it hard to read and somewhat clumsy too many disparate idea introduce for no benefit at all other than sensational part for the time a it cover stuff that was deem sensitive to say the least during communism i can see the fascination it produce at the time that t the case anymore though or maybe i see the different now or a bit of both the film try too much to cover many aspect from the book the result being a concoction of scene that may make some sense to someone who read the book even so this i a film that i difficult to watch and maybe should have never been made	negative
r48004	"Everything about this show is terrible. Its premise even sets itself up to get cheap laughs with bad writing. A ""disfunctional family""-theme has already been used too many times, most notably by the Simpsons, which is an excellent show with great writing and many laughs. Meanwhile, Family Guy has about five minutes of story in each episode, with tons of celebrity jokes and random flashbacks thrown in. Now, if this was original or funny, sure, I'd think it was clever. But no, it's not funny at all. In fact, the only reason the episodes are like this is because it is the easiest way to effortlessly crank out episode after episode of this junk. Much of this show is unoriginal, and what is original is just lame. It is also amazingly crude and irreverent, which again can be fine if it's still intelligent. Animation isn't everything either, but from an artistic point of view, this show fails also, proving yet again that Family Guy strives for as many cheap jokes and easy shortcuts as possible. People enjoy this show, and I don't really care, because people can enjoy anything they want, no matter how much it aims for the lowest common denominator. But no, I don't recommend this, especially for anyone who wants to someday study film or become a writer. This is cheap entertainment that aims low and has found success in this.

r3655	"This film promises much but delivers little. The basic problem has to do with the inclusion of Charlotte Gainsbourg's character in this film. Immigrants from Sicily did not need a redheaded Anglo in any way--the movie may have needed her, but new citizens certainly did not. In my opinion,the decision to include her destroys the continuity of the film. This is particularly troubling since it seems to demean not only the characters in the movie, but also the history of immigration itself. Immigrants themselves were heroic figures, fully capable of getting along without having to satisfied what I believer to be a veiled image of ""the white man's burden."" I wonder if someone will make a movie of Irish immigrants which will include a Sicilian woman as a major character. The Left Elbow Index considers seven aspects of film--acting, production sets, dialogue, artistry, film continuity, plot, and character development--on a scale from high of 10 for excellent, 5 for average, and 1 for needs help. Both film continuity and plot rate a low of 1. The continuity as discussed above is further degraded by the surrealistic ending. Does not a film of such important historical significance deserve more than a conclusion which reminds one of Marc Chagall? The plot is simple enough, until it seems to become entangled with too much time in the old country, too little time on the ship, and too much emphasis on the ending. The acting and character development is average since all the characters are fixed throughout the film, and the inclusion of the Anglo-Saxon speaking perfect English almost turns the movie into a satire. Where's Groucho when you need him? The production sets, the dialogue and the artistry are very good, each rating a 10. The sets in Sicily, on the ship, and on Ellis Island are as good as one can find. The dialogue is marvelous, and the ethic singing is superb. I agree with Scorsese that listening to the Sicilian dialect is a pleasure. Note that the immigrants speak of ""America"", not the ""United States""--the ideal vs. the political reality. The are many good artistic scenes, with dreams of America, gold coins raining, and giant veggies among the best. The average Left Elbow Index is 5.25, raised to a 7.0 when equated with the IMDb scale. One other notion seems to run through Ellis Island experience: the tribulations of pass immigrants was grueling, later, in 2006, one only had to pay a coyote or boat owner and sneak into the county under the darkness of night, no questions asked!

r46445	It isn't always easy to explain what a movie is like, but this time I think I've found it. It reminded me of two movies: Trainspotting (small time criminals scoring some drugs and doing some stupid things in Schotland) and The Blair Witch Project (because of the style of filming).<br /><br />It's about the loyalty between two friends, one of them is coming out of jail, the other one hasn't been caught yet. With a stolen vehicle they drive through the Scottish countryside but than run out of petrol. As they try to find some fuel, they find a farm in the middle of nowhere. The farmer thinks they want to rob him and points a gun at one of them. Than it all goes wrong. One of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer's daughter and they have to run. What follows is a man hunt through the fields and woods of Schotland. The two friends literally have to run for their lives.<br /><br />Apparently this movie was shot in only 12 days time. OK, that's not exactly unbelievable because the biggest part of it is always in the same place: the Scottish countryside, but I still find that quite amazing. Especially because this isn't actually a bad movie. It's perhaps not the greatest movie ever, but they still can be proud of what they achieved. I had a nice time watching it and overall I enjoyed the movie. I give it a 7/10.	it t always easy to explain what a movie i like but this time i think i found it it mind me of two movie trainspotting small time criminal score some drug and doing some stupid the in and the Blair witch project because of the style of film it s about the loyalty between two friend one of them i coming out of jail the other one t been caught yet with a stolen vehicle they drive through the Scottish countryside but than run out of petrol a they try to find some fuel they find a farm in the middle of nowhere the farmer think they want to rob him and point a gun at one of them than it all goes wrong one of the friend accidental shoot the farmer s daughter and they have to run what follow i a man hunt through the field and woods of the two friend literal have to run for their live apparent this movie was shot in on day time OK that s not exact believable because the biggest part of it i always in the same place the Scottish countryside but i still find that quite amazing especial because this t actual a bad movie it s perhaps not the great movie ever but they still can be proud of what they achieve i had a nice time watch it and overall i enjoy the movie i give it a 7	positive
r17213	"A movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story, the Luzhin Defence charts the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty, depth and character.<br /><br />	It gives John Turturro what is probably his finest role to date (thank goodness they didn't give it to Ralph Fiennes, who would have murdered it.) Similarly, Emily Watson shows the wealth of her experience (from her outstanding background on the stage). To reach the tortured chess master (Turturro) her character has to display intelligence as well as a woman's love. Watson does not portray beauty-pageant sexuality, but she brings to her parts a self-awareness that is alluring.<br /><br />	In a chance meeting between Natalia (Watson) and Luzhin, she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing - a specially crafted piece that, we realize later in the film, has come to symbolize his hopes and aspirations. Later, as their love affair develops, she subtly likens dancing to chess (Luzhin has learnt to dance but never with a partner); she encourages him to lead her with ""bold, brilliant moves"" and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best (and also realize himself as her lover).<br /><br />	This is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and, in so doing finds her own deepest fulfillment, emotionally and intellectually (Or so we are led to believe - certainly, within the time frame, Natalia is something of a liberated woman rather than someone who grooms herself to be a stereotypical wife and mother).<br /><br />	The Italian sets are stunning.

r18811	Believe it or not, at 12 minutes, this film (for 1912) is a full-length film. Very, very few films were longer than that back then, but that is definitely NOT what sets this odd little film apart from the rest! No, what's different is that all the actors (with the exception of one frog) are bugs...yes, bugs! This simple little domestic comedy could have looked much like productions starring the likes of Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder but instead this Russian production uses bugs (or, I think, models that looked just like bugs). Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy were yet to be discovered and I assume Linder was busy, so perhaps that's why they used bugs! Using stop-motion, the bugs moved and danced and fought amazingly well--and a heck of a lot more realistically than King Kong 21 years later! <br /><br />The film starts with Mr. Beetle sneaking off for a good time. He goes to a bawdy club while his wife supposedly waits at home. But, unfortunately for Mr. Beetle, he is caught on camera by a local film buff. Plus, he doesn't know it but Mrs. Beetle is also carrying on with a bohemian grasshopper painter. Of course, there's a lot more to this domestic comedy than this, but the plot is age-old and very entertaining for adults and kids alike.<br /><br />Weird but also very amazing and watchable.	believe it or not at minute this film for i a full length film very very few film were longer than that back then but that i definite not what set this odd little film apart from the rest no what s different i that all the actor with the exception of one frog are bug yes bug this simple little domestic comedy could have look much like production starring the like of Chaplin laurel and hardy or max but instead this Russian production use bug or i think model that look just like bug Chaplin and laurel and hardy were yet to be discovered and i assume was busy so perhaps that s why they used bug use stop motion the bug moved and dance and fought amazing well and a heck of a lot more realistically than king Kong year late the film start with Mr beetle sneaking off for a good time he goes to a bawdy club while hi wife supposed wait at home but fortunate for Mr beetle he i caught on camera by a local film buff plus he t know it but Mr beetle i also carry on with a bohemian grasshopper painter of course there s a lot more to this domestic comedy than this but the plot i age old and very entertaining for adult and kid alike weird but also very amazing and watchable	positive
r42228	"I nominate this and BABYLON 5 as the best television sci-fi series made. Both stand out in my mind because unlike early STAR TREK series, there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK:TNG, they were fine shows, but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes. In many ways, you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring. This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its giant battles that took up all of the final season) and the other TREK shows, as there was more of a larger story that unified them. This coherence seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with SG-1. The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form. Sure, there were a few ""throwaway"" episodes that were not connected to the rest, but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny.<br /><br />And speaking of funny, I loved that SG-1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasn't so dreadfully serious. In this way, I actually enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of Homer Simpson--it's really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons.<br /><br />To truly appreciate SG-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work. This coherence gives the show exceptional staying power. And, if you don't like SG-1 after giving it a fair chance, then sci-fi is probably NOT the genre for you."	i nominate this and Babylon 5 a the best television sci series made both stand out in my mind because unlike early star trek series there i a consistent evolution of plot and character if you look at the original star trek and star trek they were fine show but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episode in many way you could usual watch the show total out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what i occurring this was less the case with deep space 9 with it giant battle that took up all of the final season and the other trek show a there was more of a large story that unify them this coherence seem to have developed a a concept with Babylon 5 and saw this to an even great extent with 1 the bottom line i that in many way this series was like watch a family or a long novel slow take form sure there were a few throwaway episode that were not connected to the rest but these were very few and far between and were also usual pretty funny and speak of funny i loved that 1 kept the mood light from time to time and t so dreadful serious in this way i actual enjoy it more than Babylon 5 jack o was a great character with hi sarcasm and love of homer Simpson it s real too bad he slow fad from the series in late season to truly appreciate 1 you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricate the plot work this coherence give the show exceptional stay power and if you don t like 1 aft give it a fair chance then sci i probably not the genre for you	positive
r44099	Having heard quite positive reviews and having seen the trailer I had to see this movie. With William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell present it had to be good.

SPOILER At the end, where they break through the wall to get to the safe and we see Rockwell and Washington stare at Jeter is just fantastic. This is just as good as the scene in The Big Lebowski where The Dude is using a chair to barricade his door, but forgets the door turns outward!

r26369	In spite of its high-minded ambitions, Zurlini's film must be seen as a failure. It's one thing to create a world which draws the viewer into feeling the tedium and angst experienced by the protagonist (which I think is what Zurlini was attempting). It's another thing entirely to make a film that is itself tedious and meaninglessly episodic. Despite beautiful cinematography at a haunting location - and a wonderful score - the film never lures the audience in. Too much is unintentionally funny (the phony sound of dripping water in Drago's quarters, for example, or the silent-movie mugging by some of the actors) or simply confusing (Why exactly does Drago want to leave the fort the first time?) for the film to succeed as a coherent work.	in spite of it high minded ambition s film must be seen a a failure it s one thing to create a world which draw the viewer to feeling the tedium and angst experience by the protagonist which i think i what was attempt it s another thing entire to make a film that i itself tedious and meaningless episodic despite beautiful cinematography at a haunting location and a wonderful score the film never lure the audience in too much i intentional funny the phony sound of dripping water in s quarter for example or the silent movie mugging by some of the actor or simply confusing why exact does want to leave the fort the first time for the film to succeed a a coherent work	negative
r37751	In order to avoid confusion, let me clarify a couple of points: I am not a red neck. I am not even a moderate nor a conservative. Quite on the contrary, I am a radical: a Libertarian. I'm not a WASP either, I was not even born in the States.<br /><br />Jorge Luis Borges used to say that there are some kind of folk who do not feel poetry, and that these sad people usually earn their living teaching poetry. This movie was made by and for people who do not feel poetry, by and for show-offs; and I dare say, by and for people who have no sense of decency or, for that matter, respect for other people's life or death (especially when the victims are thought to be mostly 'bloody imperialists' killed in Yankee soil.) I even find the original marketing idea of the eleven episodes of eleven minutes, nine seconds and one frame as particularly hideous and repulsive. Just plain awful. Why didn't they assign a budget of as many dollars per episode as individuals were brutally murdered in the attack? The whole idea rests somewhere between mere stupidity and reckless fascism. Anybody who is serious about film-making (and serious about life and death) should have angrily declined to participate in this recollection of innuendoes and non-sequiturs. With two exceptions: the episode of Burkina Faso -- almost amusing --, and the one from India --which documents the story of a man who was unfairly and wrongly investigated in relation to the attack, on the basis that afterwards he didn't return home and that he was an American Muslim (and, truth be told, when the facts were known he was honored as a hero). All other nine episodes, essentially and extremely boring and emotionless, can be listed in two different categories:<br /><br />First: 'I don't care about the thousands of victims: Americans, foreigners, children, youngsters, adults, old-timers...' and can be resumed in pure boredom and lack of emotion. Makhmalbaf's (Iran); Lelouch's (France)  I'm afraid I'm going to commit an heresy since it's Lelouch's, but maybe, his episode might be considered built upon an idea which could be regarded as almost original; Tanovic's (Bosnia-Herzegovina); Gonzalez Inarritu's (Mexico); Gitaï's (Israel); Penn's (USA) <br /><br />Second: 'The bloody Yankees deserve it'. And can be resumed in frustration and hatred. Chahine (Egypt) vindicates the suicide bombers; Loach (UK) considers the 9/11 reckless attacks were some kind of punishment for the alleged support of the USA to the Chilean dictatorship headed by the serial-killer Augusto Pinochet, in fact someone should inform Mr. Loach that the victims of Pinochet were not related to Al-Qaida and that Chile is a South American country which sole existence Mr. Bin Laden should have ignored, he ought to be informed too that the American government sanctions against the Chilean dictatorship were harder than any other ciountrie's; and, Imamura (Japan) windingly points out that WWII is related the attack to the WTC. Imamura has at least been coherent in this: the supposed cause effect linking is entirely nonsensical, which plays well with his episode including a man who believes himself to be a snake. It pretends to be obscure. It is, instead, quite ludicrous.<br /><br />There's some kind of error shared by many, including some Americans, and it consists in the belief that this movie wasn't commercially screened in the States because of some kind of censorship. Nothing further from the truth: This movie wasn't screened in the States because it is a complete fiasco. A fiasco of the wackyest kind. Even in Buenos Aires, where Peronism and other forms of Fascism are nearest and dearest to the hearts of a sizable number of its inhabitants, and anti-Americanism is in vogue, the movie was screened in living rooms hurriedly converted into theaters, and was applauded by a very select public: The usual sad few who routinely lend their applause to other equally 'quaint' spectacles. Like the sight of a McDonald's fast-food restaurant or, perchance, an elderly Jew, being burnt to ashes.	in order to avoid fusion let me clarify a couple of point i am not a red neck i am not even a moderate nor a conservative quite on the contrary i am a radical a libertarian i m not a WASP either i was not even born in the state Jorge Luis Borges used to say that there are some kind of folk who do not feel poetry and that these sad people usual earn their living teaching poetry this movie was made by and for people who do not feel poetry by and for show off and i dare say by and for people who have no sense of decency or for that matter respect for other people s life or death especial when the victim are thought to be most bloody imperialist kill in Yankee soil i even find the original marketing idea of the eleven episode of eleven minute nine second and one frame a particular hideous and repulsive just plain awful why t they assign a budget of a many dollar p episode a individual were brutal murder in the attack the whole idea rest somewhere between mere stupidity and reckless fascism anybody who i serious about film making and serious about life and death should have angrily decline to participate in this collection of and non with two exception the episode of almost amusing and the one from India which document the story of a man who was unfair and wrong investigate in relation to the attack on the basis that afterward he t turn home and that he was an American Muslim and truth be told when the fact were known he was honor a a hero all other nine episode essentially and extreme boring and emotionless can be listed in two different category first i don t care about the thousand of victim American foreign children youngster adult old time and can be resume in pure boredom and lack of emotion s Iran s France i m afraid i m going to commit an heresy since it s s but maybe hi episode might be considered built upon an idea which could be regard a almost original s Bosnia Herzegovina Gonzalez s Mexico s Israel Penn s USA second the bloody Yankee serve it and can be resume in frustration and hatred Egypt vindicate the suicide bomb UK consider the 9 reckless attack were some kind of punishment for the alleged support of the USA to the Chilean dictatorship head by the serial killer Pinochet in fact someone should inform Mr that the victim of Pinochet were not relate to Al and that Chile i a south American country which sole existence Mr bin laden should have ignore he ought to be informed too that the American government sanction against the Chilean dictatorship were hard than any other s and japan point out that WWII i relate the attack to the ha at least been coherent in this the supposed cause effect link i entire nonsensical which play well with hi episode include a man who believe himself to be a snake it pretend to be obscure it i instead quite ludicrous there s some kind of error share by many include some American and it consist in the belief that this movie t commercial screen in the state because of some kind of censorship nothing further from the truth this movie t screen in the state because it i a complete fiasco a fiasco of the kind even in Aires where and other form of fascism are near and dearest to the heart of a sizable number of it inhabitant and anti Americanism i in vogue the movie was screen in living room hurried converted to theater and was applaud by a very select public the usual sad few who routine lend their applause to other equal quaint spectacles like the sight of a McDonald s fast food restaurant or perchance an elder jew being burnt to ash	negative

r40319	"Bob Clampett's 'The Hep Cat' is a distinctly average cartoon only really notable for the fact that it was the first colour Looney Tune (previously Looney Tunes were all black and white while Merrie Melodies were in colour). The tale of a singing, dancing cat's attempts to woo a lady cat and a dog's attempts to catch the cat, 'The Hep Cat' lacks the trademark energy and pace of most Clampett shorts. To be fair, Clampett doesn't have a great deal to work with. Warren Foster's script is embarrassingly thin and, while he has spun straw into gold with other cartoons, Clampett doesn't manage it with 'The Hep Cat'. It's often said of Clampett that you can't mistake his cartoons for anyone else's and it's generally true but 'The Hep Cat' is an exception. There's flashes of Clampett genius, such as the chase scene in which the cat stops to ask the dog ""Hey, are you following me"". When the dog confirms that he is, the cat simply says ""Oh"" and the chase immediately resumes. Unfortunately, there's very little of such brilliance on show here.

r10821	"(some spoilers) - as if you wouldn't know how it'll end<br /><br />My expectations for HOLLOW MAN were high. A very good commercial, a director like Paul Verhoeven and actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, plus a very interesting theme - invisibility. Every premise for a great movie was accomplished. Unfortunately these things didn't matter at all. The movie was very very week, without suspense and awfully predictable. <br /><br />It's all about a bunch of scientists who discovered invisibility. After the tests on animals succeeded, Kevin Bacon decides to test it on himself. Once he's invisible, he changes completely, realizing the advantages of not being seen. From this to murder there's a very thin line.<br /><br />Hollow Man is an ill movie. It suffers of the disease that many new movies have: the special effects. From a challenging theme that could have lead the producers to a great tensed psychological thriller, Verhoeven ruins everything focusing only on special effects, without giving a damn about the real value of the movie. I must admit, the fx are awesome, probably the best i have seen since Matrix, but that's not enough to make a movie good. Actually that's the problem with the movies today. Just like Verhoeven, most directors care only about spectacular scenes - and nothing more. The exceptions are very few, and probably the Matrix is the only movie that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great plot.<br /><br />After Starship Troopers, Verhoeven disappoints again. In stead of a great film, HM is cr*p. There are only 2 reasons why you could watch this movie: 1. the special effects 2. the joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (i won't spoil this moment for you...)<br /><br />Okay, so what went wrong with the movie? Everything. Let's see what i can remember.<br /><br />--- It's not tensed at all. It should've been, but it's not.<br /><br />--- It's too predictable . You know from the beginning who will die and who will live.<br /><br />--- In stead of focusing on the psychological part, Verhoeven cares only about the effects.<br /><br />--- Very many cliches. <br /><br />--- Of course the bad guy wakes up a few times before dying.<br /><br />--- Just like in every low quality horror, the first rule is to let the characters separate as much as possible. Every time there is somebody alone in the lab, perfect victim for Bacon.<br /><br />--- Some holes in the plot. Example: at the beginning, Bacon has to scan his finger to enter the lab. After he's invisible, how can he do that?<br /><br />--- The ending: absolutely horrible.<br /><br />--- After Shue hits Bacon in the head, Bacon falls down to the ground. Then Shue and Brolin leave quietly and slowly, without looking back. Is that normal? Then Bacon gets up, attacks them, they ""kill"" him again. And then Shue screams ""I heard an explosion"" (happened minutes ago), and they suddenly run inside. Didn't she hear that explosion some time before?<br /><br />--- There's a scene in which you can see the microphones hanging above the actors. Come on, Mr Verhoeven , i expected much more from you!<br /><br />So that's about Hollow Man. What was supposed to be a great movie turned into a scam. <br /><br />Vote: 4 out of 10 (for the special effects)"	some spoil a if you t know how it ll end my expectation for hollow man were high a very good commercial a director like Paul and actor like Kevin bacon and Elisabeth plus a very interesting theme visibility every premise for a great movie was accomplished fortunate these the t matter at all the movie was very very week without suspense and awful predictable it s all about a bunch of scientist who discovered visibility aft the test on animal succeed Kevin bacon decide to test it on himself once he s visible he change complete realize the advantage of not being seen from this to murder there s a very thin line hollow man i an ill movie it suffer of the ease that many new movie have the special effect from a challenge theme that could have lead the produce to a great tense psychological thriller ruin everything focus on on special effect without give a damn about the real value of the movie i must admit the are awesome probably the best i have seen since matrix but that s not enough to make a movie good actual that s the problem with the movie today just like most director care on about spectacular scene and nothing more the exception are very few and probably the matrix i the on movie that combine perfect fabulous special effect and great plot aft troop appoint again in stead of a great film HM i p there are on 2 reason why you could watch this movie 1 the special effect 2 the joke with superman and wonder woman i won t spoil this moment for you okay so what went wrong with the movie everything let s see what i can remember it s not tense at all it should been but it s not it s too predictable you know from the beginning who will die and who will live in stead of focus on the psychological part care on about the effect very many cliche of course the bad guy wake up a few time before dying just like in every low quality horror the first rule i to let the character separate a much a possible every time there i somebody alone in the lab perfect victim for bacon some hole in the plot example at the beginning bacon ha to scan hi finger to enter the lab aft he s visible how can he do that the ending absolute horrible aft hit bacon in the head bacon fall down to the ground then and leave quiet and slow without look back i that normal then bacon get up attack them they kill him again and then scream i heard an explosion happen minute ago and they sudden run inside t she hear that explosion some time before there s a scene in which you can see the microphone hanging above the actor come on Mr i expect much more from you so that s about hollow man what was supposed to be a great movie turn to a scam vote 4 out of for the special effect	negative
r19061	"Imagine turning out the lights in your remote farmhouse on a cold night, and then going to bed. There's no need to lock the doors. The only sound is the wind whistling through the trees. Sometime after midnight a car with lights off inches up the driveway. Moments later an intruder beams a flashlight into your darkened living room.<br /><br />What makes this image so scary is the setting: a remote farmhouse ... at night. Based on Truman Capote's best-selling book, and with B&W lighting comparable to the best 1940's noir films, ""In Cold Blood"" presents a terrifying story, especially in that first Act, as the plot takes place largely at night and on rain drenched country roads. It's the stuff of nightmares. But this is no dream. The events really happened, in 1959.<br /><br />Two con men with heads full of delusions kill an entire Kansas family, looking for a stash of cash that doesn't exist. Director Richard Brooks used the actual locations where the real-life events occurred, even the farmhouse ... and its interior! It makes for a memorable, and haunting, film.<br /><br />Both of the lead actors closely resemble the two real-life killers. Robert Blake is more than convincing as Perry Smith, short and stocky with a bum leg, who dreams of finding Cortez' buried treasure. Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock, the smooth-talking con artist with an all-American smile.<br /><br />After their killing spree, the duo head to Mexico. Things go awry there, so they come back to the U.S., stealing cars, hitchhiking, and generally being miserable as they roam from place to place. But it's a fool's life, and the two outlaws soon regret their actions. The film's final twenty minutes are mesmerizing, as the rain falls, the rope tightens, and all we hear is the pounding of a beating heart.<br /><br />Even with its somewhat mundane middle Act, ""In Cold Blood"" stages in riveting detail a real-life story that still hypnotizes, nearly half a century later. It's that setting that does it. Do you suppose people in rural Kansas still leave their doors unlocked ... at night?"	imagine turning out the light in your remote farmhouse on a cold night and then going to bed there s no need to lock the door the on sound i the wind whistle through the tree sometime aft midnight a car with light off inch up the driveway moment late an intruder beam a flashlight to your darken living room what make this image so scary i the setting a remote farmhouse at night base on Truman Capote s best sell book and with b w light comparable to the best s film in cold blood present a terrifying story especial in that first act a the plot take place large at night and on rain drench country road it s the stuff of nightmare but this i no dream the event real happen in two con men with head full of delusion kill an entire Kansas family look for a stash of cash that t exist director Richard brook used the actual location where the real life event occurred even the farmhouse and it interior it make for a memorable and haunting film both of the lead actor close resemble the two real life kill Robert Blake i more than convincing a Perry smith short and stocky with a bum leg who dream of finding bury treasure Scott Wilson i almost a good a dick the smooth talk con artist with an all American smile aft their killing spree the duo head to Mexico the go awry there so they come back to the u s steal car hitchhike and general being miser a they roam from place to place but it s a fool s life and the two outlaw soon regret their action the film s final twenty minute are mesmerize a the rain fall the rope tight and all we hear i the pounding of a beating heart even with it somewhat mundane middle act in cold blood stage in rivet tail a real life story that still hypnotize near half a century late it s that setting that does it do you suppose people in rural Kansas still leave their door unlock at night	positive
r35436	The Gymnast (2006) was written and directed by Ned Farr. Dreya Weber portrays Jane Hawkins, a former world-class gymnast who was seriously injured and now earns her living as a certified massage therapist.<br /><br />The promotional material leads you to believe that the plot hinges around Jane's accidental reunion with a former teammate. Although this meeting takes place, that plot line is secondary to the main plot, which involves Jane, her husband, and a professional dancer named Serena (Addie Yungmee). The two women develop an act of the type performed by Cirque de Soleil. The two complement each other--Jane is more experienced with heights and has tremendous upper body strength. Serena is more elegant and artistic, although, obviously, also capable of incredible physical feats.<br /><br />The film works because we can understand how Jane would turn to Addie, who is caring and compassionate, while Jane's husband has taken her for granted for the many years of their marriage.<br /><br />Both women are incredibly fit and athletic, and Dreya has the lean body and well-defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts. They clearly are truly performing their act, and the results are so excellent that we can believe they would indeed, be a success in Las Vegas, or anywhere else they traveled.<br /><br />The sexual tension between the women is obvious, and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while suspended in the air. A woman with a neglectful husband and an attractive woman partner make for an explosive situation, which isn't resolved in a neat and tidy fashion.<br /><br />Of the six films we saw at the Rochester NY Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival, we thought this one was the best. It will work on DVD, and is definitely worth seeking out on large or small screen.

r16825	I was attracted to this movie when I looked at cast list, but after I watched it I must admit that I felt a bit disappointed. The main problem of this movie is that actors aren't capable of holding this movie on their back. Why? Because of bad script. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones try very hard to take this movie on another level, there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too ordinary. So for Matt Dillon fans this is watchable movie, just like for admirers of beautiful Diane Lane. Legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great but this is not movie for him; far below his level. So if you get hooked up by this great cast watch it but don't expect anything big or extraordinary. The only thing that you'll remember about this flick is Diane Lane scenes; rest of it is very forgettable.	i was attract to this movie when i look at cast list but aft i watch it i must admit that i felt a bit appoint the main problem of this movie i that actor t capable of holding this movie on their back why because of bad script although Dillon lane and Jones try very hard to take this movie on another level there i no innovate storytelling and the direction i too ordinary so for Matt Dillon fan this i watchable movie just like for admire of beautiful Diane lane legendary Tommy lee Jones i always great but this i not movie for him far below hi level so if you get hook up by this great cast watch it but don t expect anything big or extraordinary the on thing that you ll remember about this flick i Diane lane scene rest of it i very forgettable	negative

r17277	"Why is it better? Because it's true to the dark vision of the comic. Because the imagery is inventive and, unlike the first, there are real moments of fear and pathos in this one. The first one had too much of Jack Nicholson's shtick, too much Prince music, and an awkward ""romance."" Here, instead of one villain, there are three. No Robert Wuhl, and the leading lady is more than just a pretty face. In fact, Pfeiffer is the #1 attraction of this film. Her transformation is what drives the running theme, teetering on the edge of sanity and insanity, good and evil. She becomes truly fearsome. The costumes and makeup are excellent. Danny DeVito's Penguin is inspired and anguished, not just a nut. His circus gang posse is the one element of comic relief (besides that giant duck). Max Shrek is the only character I'd have toned down, Walken is pretty hammy as the ruthless businessman. Danny Elfman's score is a perfect fit as usual, and the Siouxie and the Banshees song (""Face to Face"") is easily the best of any of the songs from any of the films, a perfect match of musical artist and film soundtrack. The least campy of the films, it is macabre, doesn't pander, and demands second and third viewings like an amusement park ride.

r5923	It would require the beauty and eloquence of Shakespeare to do justice to this outstanding cinematic feat. Nevertheless, I'll give it a go.<br /><br />As far as adaptations of Hamlet go this one is already at a better starting point than all other versions since it encompasses the entire play. Still this is no guarantee for a first-rate movie, or even a good one. Usually I'm not much for movies that are overlong and the trend that seems to be prevalent in Hollywood today, namely that movies should be at least two hours long, preferably three, is one that hopefully won't last long. Few stories are strong enough to withstand such extensive exploration and could do with some cutting. Making a four-hour-long movie and keeping it interesting is no small undertaking, but Kenneth Branagh pulls it off with flying colours. He has managed to make a very long movie seem no more than any average movie. I was completely engrossed from start to finish.<br /><br />The cast is excellent with Kenneth Branagh himself as the tormented prince giving a strong and memorable performance. He manages to convey his feelings admirably through his voice and one does not have to be an expert on Shakespearean verse to catch the myriad of emotions that are waging inside him. Kate Winslet was a positive surprise, I must say. I didn't know what to expect really. I've always liked her well enough as an actor, but wasn't sure she could pull off playing Shakespeare. Well, she certainly eradicated all doubts with her performance. She is the best Ophelia I have seen and lent such depth to the character and was simply wonderful. Other brilliant performances are Derek Jacobi as Claudius, Richard Briers as Polonius and Nicholas Farrell as Horatio to name but a few. I liked the fact that Branagh used some internationally more famous stars to play in some of the minor roles; I especially enjoyed the sparring between Hamlet and the gravedigger played by Billy Crystal.<br /><br />The setting of the play in the 19th century gives a welcome change to the usually gloomier Gothic settings. It is overall much lighter than other versions I've seen, more colourful and lavish, but this does not distract from the tragedy of the play. It is exceptional, stylish and aesthetically pleasing, a definite delight to the eye and other senses as well. The music by Patrick Doyle is as always magical and thoroughly in tune with the movie. One can only feel a deep sense of satisfaction after having seen this. I am shocked and appalled that this exquisite work of art did not win an Academy award for best picture, even more so that it wasn't even nominated. There is no way there was a better movie made that year, or any other year for that matter. This is as close to perfection as you can hope to get.<br /><br />To sum up, a stunning work of pure genius and I cannot see how anyone could top this. My hat's off to you Mr. Branagh.	it would require the beauty and eloquence of Shakespeare to do justice to this outstanding cinematic feat nevertheless i ll give it a go a far a adaptation of hamlet go this one i already at a better start point than all other version since it encompass the entire play still this i no guarantee for a first rate movie or even a good one usual i m not much for movie that are overlong and the trend that seem to be prevalent in Hollywood today namely that movie should be at least two hour long preferably three i one that hopeful won t last long few story are strong enough to withstand such extensive exploration and could do with some cutting making a four hour long movie and keeping it interesting i no small undertaking but Kenneth pull it off with flying he ha manage to make a very long movie seem no more than any average movie i was complete engross from start to finish the cast i excellent with Kenneth himself a the torment prince give a strong and memorable performance he manage to convey hi feel admirably through hi voice and one does not have to be an expert on Shakespearean verse to catch the myriad of emote that are wag inside him Kate was a positive surprise i must say i t know what to expect real i always like h well enough a an actor but t sure she could pull off play Shakespeare well she certain eradicate all doubt with h performance she i the best Ophelia i have seen and lent such depth to the character and was simply wonderful other brilliant performance are Derek Jacobi a Claudius Richard brie a and Nicholas Farrell a Horatio to name but a few i like the fact that used some international more famous star to play in some of the minor role i especial enjoy the sparring between hamlet and the gravedigger play by billy crystal the setting of the play in the 19th century give a welcome change to the usual gloomy Gothic sett it i overall much lighter than other version i seen more and lavish but this does not distract from the tragedy of the play it i exceptional stylish and aesthetically pleasing a definite light to the eye and other sense a well the music by Patrick Doyle i a always magical and thorough in tune with the movie one can on feel a deep sense of satisfaction aft have seen this i am shock and appall that this exquisite work of art did not win an academy award for best picture even more so that it t even nominate there i no way there was a better movie made that year or any other year for that matter this i a close to perfection a you can hope to get to sum up a stunning work of pure genius and i cannot see how anyone could top this my hat s off to you Mr	positive
r8797	I happen to like Leslie Howard, in his better films. Yet, for some reason, his performance in OF HUMAN BONDAGE never has moved me tremendously. I first saw the film on my college campus in 1972 and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the 1930s and 1940s Howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by Dirk Bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed. This is not usually the case (off hand I think of Ashley Wilkes as a man who might be betrayed, if he and Scarlett O'Hara were meant to be an item by Margaret Mitchell - but Ashley loved Melonie, not Scarlett). Howard could play any type, and a role like R. J. Mitchell or Professor Henry Higgins is not one who is betrayed.*<br /><br />(*One can make the case that Philip Armstrong Scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in 49TH PARALLEL, but they are Nazis who consider him - a liberal, westerner, Canadian - fair game to double cross in wartime. It isn't the same as emotional betrayal, and Howard does not shrivel up as a result, but faces the Nazis and captures one after beating him up.) <br /><br />I think what the reviewer meant was that Howard could be soulful - or try to be soulful. Witness his poet - dreamer - wanderer in THE PETRIFIED FORREST. But that character was not betrayed, except by history perhaps (as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by Humphrey Bogart). The character of Philip Carey in Somerset Maugham's OF HUMAN BONDAGE is soulful too. He is sensitive for several reasons. He has an interest in art and tries to become a painter - but unlike the artist Strickland in THE MOON AND SIXPENCE he has no real talent. So he decides to concentrate on medical studies, accentuated by a club foot condition he has. Here he is a man with low self-esteem who is set up to be betrayed.<br /><br />Philip finds that betrayal in the form of Mildred a Cockney waitress (Bette Davis) who is mercenary and as selfish as they come. Why Philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film, but he does find the woman fascinating. And she finds him an easy meal ticket. Ironically in being so captivated by this slut, Philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him (Kay Johnson and Frances Dee), and are more fit to be his mate. He also keeps finding himself forgiving Davis when she has affairs with other men (Alan Hale and Reginald Denny - the latter a friend of Howard's). <br /><br />Although Howard's performance captures the doormat tendency of Philip towards Mildred, he really does not show enough passion (until late in the movie, when he turns on her). That is why I find I never cared for his performance here - it lacks any reality. His later tortured insistence in GONE WITH THE WIND that he loves Olivia De Haviland, not Vivian Leigh, has more consistency with a man in love. But the performance of Davis as Mildred makes the film important. She had a wide variety of parts up to 1934, like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in THE MAN WHO PLAYED GOD or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered in FOG OVER FRISCO or the mouse-like secretary in THREE ON A MATCH. As Mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitch.<br /><br />Curiously her performance was not all of one note. While she uses and abuses Howard for two thirds of the film, culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her, her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating, and her inability to keep any honest jobs. When Howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes (he asks what happened to her baby - she tells him the baby died and Howard says brusquely that he is glad, which is hardly the response she expects). In the end Howard does finally get his life in order, but Mildred ends a casualty (ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend Denny on a medical call). The Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences did fail to nominate Davis in 1934 (leading to the largest write - in campaign in it's history, and a permanent change in it's rules), but Davis was established as a star. In one year she won the Oscar as Joyce Heth in DANGEROUS. And in two years she co-starred with Howard again (as equal stars) in THE PETRIFIED FORREST.	i happen to like Leslie Howard in hi better film yet for some reason hi performance in of human bondage never ha moved me tremendous i first saw the film on my college campus in and the viewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the and Howard play the role supposed late pick up by dirk a the man who was born to be betray this i not usual the case off hand i think of Ashley Wilkes a a man who might be betray if he and o were meant to be an item by Margaret Mitchell but Ashley loved not Howard could play any type and a role like r j Mitchell or professor Henry Higgins i not one who i betray one can make the case that Philip Armstrong Scott i betray by the two strange he show hospitality to in 49th parallel but they are Nazi who consider him a liberal westerner Canadian fair game to double cross in wartime it t the same a emotional betrayal and Howard does not shrivel up a a result but face the Nazi and capture one aft beating him up i think what the viewer meant was that Howard could be soulful or try to be soulful witness hi poet dreamer wanderer in the petrify Forrest but that character was not betray except by history perhaps a he feel hi type i a out of date a the gangster play by Humphrey Bogart the character of Philip Carey in somerset Maugham s of human bondage i soulful too he i sensitive for several reason he ha an interest in art and try to become a painter but unlike the artist Strickland in the moon and sixpence he ha no real talent so he decide to concentrate on medical study accentuate by a club foot condition he ha here he i a man with low self esteem who i set up to be betray Philip find that betrayal in the form of Mildred a cockney waitress Bette Davis who i mercenary and a selfish a they come why Philip fall for h i not real addressed in the film but he does find the woman fascinating and she find him an easy meal ticket ironical in being so captivate by this slut Philip fail to notice two other women who are interested in him Kay Johnson and Frances Dee and are more fit to be hi mate he also keep finding himself forgiving Davis when she ha affair with other men Alan hale and Reginald Denny the latter a friend of Howard s although Howard s performance capture the doormat tendency of Philip toward Mildred he real does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turn on h that i why i find i never car for hi performance here it lack any reality hi late torture insistence in gone with the wind that he love Olivia not Vivian Leigh ha more consistency with a man in love but the performance of Davis a Mildred make the film important she had a wide variety of part up to like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in the man WHO play god or the spoiled heiress who get murder in fog over Frisco or the mouse like secretary in three ON a match a Mildred she final show she could be a major actress by play a selfish bitch curious h performance was not all of one note while she use and abuse Howard for two third of the film culminate in that famous scene where she show how disgusted hi kiss of h made h h last scene show she too could fall apart due to h health deteriorate and h ability to keep any honest job when Howard reject h the view fail to note how equal vicious he become he ask what happen to h baby she tell him the baby die and Howard say brusque that he i glad which i hard the response she expect in the end Howard does final get hi life in order but Mildred end a casualty ironical h death discovered by h old boyfriend Denny on a medical call the motion picture academy of art and science did fail to nominate Davis in leading to the large write in campaign in it s history and a permanent change in it s rule but Davis was establish a a star in one year she won the Oscar a Joyce in dangerous and in two year she co starred with Howard again a equal star in the petrify Forrest	positive

r20223	Average viewers looking for any sense of internal coherence in a film should probably give this one a pass. It generates the same feeling as staring at a curious array of individual images that seem to have some relationship one to another, but never coalesce into a totality.<br /><br />While this isolative approach to creating a kind of cinematic montage may appeal to a few students or critics steeped in the inside language of contemporary filmmaking, it is flatly irritating and condescending to us commoners who just fell off the haywagon. An overt avoidance of accessibility may be the intentional hallmark of auteurs like Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but to me it comes across as Andy Warhol warmed over. The only redeeming characteristic I find is in the production values, and them there just ain't going to cut it all by themselfs.<br /><br />This is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and wait anxiously and in vain for some clever development of an idea or thought to sustain all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes. Sorry. The calligraphic credits unexpectedly begin to roll just as your interest begins to stir. I get the same big yawn and let-down reading what I guess are very knowledgeable and thorough comments about this film that never lead to anything truly comprehensible.

Unfortunately, the soul is his double and he must confront him frequently, tearing his life apart. There are some wonderful scenes with people fading out and, of course, the scenes when the two are on the stage at the same time. The middle part is a bit dull, but the Faustian story is always in the minds of the viewer. One thing I have to mention is the general unattractiveness of the people in the movie. Also, they pretty much shied away from much action which would have at least given some life to the thing. I first was made aware of this movie about 25 years ago and have finally been able to see it. I was not disappointed.	those engage the movie camera so early in the century must have figure out some of it potential very early on this i a good story of a playboy type who need money and inadvertent sell hi soul to Satan for a lot of money fortunate the soul i hi double and he must front him frequent tear hi life apart there are some wonderful scene with people fading out and of course the scene when the two are on the stage at the same time the middle part i a bit dull but the Faustian story i always in the mind of the viewer one thing i have to mention i the general of the people in the movie also they pretty much shy away from much action which would have at least given some life to the thing i first was made aware of this movie about year ago and have final been able to see it i was not appoint	positive
r49837	What a horrible movie. This movie was so out of order and so hard to follow.It was so hard to follow and was just confusing. The whole time I was watching it I was wishing it would end!!I felt like I wasted 2hours of my life that I will never get back. Save your money and don't rent this movie. I now see why Sarah Michelle Gellar was barely in the movie. The first movie was great but this was just sucked. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Save your money and watch the trailer because that is about the only thing that is worth seeing with this movie. This movie had no real story to it either. I am still wondering what I watched.	what a horrible movie this movie was so out of order and so hard to follow it was so hard to follow and was just confusing the whole time i was watch it i was wish it would end i felt like i waste 2 of my life that i will never get back save your money and don t rent this movie i now see why Sarah Michelle was bare in the movie the first movie was great but this was just suck i would never commend this movie to anyone save your money and watch the trailer because that i about the on thing that i worth seeing with this movie this movie had no real story to it either i am still wondering what i watch	negative
r30100	I saw this movie on TV and loved it! I am a real disaster film fan, and this one was great. The cast was made of some really interesting people. Connie Selleca is always great. And William Devane is in a league of his own. He can play both comedy and thriller in the same movie like few others can. The story line is great too. The thought of being able to follow a time line of what will happen, and to use this time line to prevent a global disaster is an interesting idea. And this movie brings it out in such a way that is almost totally believable.	i saw this movie on TV and loved it i am a real aster film fan and this one was great the cast was made of some real interesting people Connie i always great and William i in a league of hi own he can play both comedy and thriller in the same movie like few other can the story line i great too the thought of being able to follow a time line of what will happen and to use this time line to prevent a global aster i an interesting idea and this movie bring it out in such a way that i almost total believable	positive
r34861	That is no criticism of the film, but rather a comment on how blind we are to our own past. <br /><br />I recently watched Winter Soldier, and The Ground Truth was like watching a remake or sequel-- except it was about Iraq rather than Vietnam. Similar to Winter Soldier because of it's one-sided message, both films illustrate how gleefully we rush to engage in conflicts based on false pretenses, and allow our young and brave (and often naive) to bear the brunt of this greedy war profiteering. Both films effectively show that the mentality forced into the minds of the young and willing make them efficient killing machines, but the training falls woefully short of teaching the diplomatic and policing skills necessary to effectively win the hearts and minds of the people they're supposedly fighting for. This is ultimately what lost the war in Vietnam, and will likely lose the war in Iraq as well. <br /><br />My only negative comment is that the film is so one-sided it could be easily passed off as left- wing propaganda. Not by me, mind you, but by those aiming to discredit the film and message. A more balanced point of view would speak to a larger audience.	that i no criticism of the film but rather a comment on how blind we are to our own past i recent watch winter soldier and the ground truth was like watch a make or sequel except it was about Iraq rather than Vietnam similar to winter soldier because of it s one side message both film illustrate how gleeful we rush to engage in conflict base on false pretense and allow our young and brave and often naive to bear the brunt of this greedy war profiteering both film effective show that the mentality forced to the mind of the young and willing make them efficient killing machine but the training fall woeful short of teaching the diplomatic and police skill necessary to effective win the heart and mind of the people they re supposed fighting for this i ultimate what lost the war in Vietnam and will likely lose the war in Iraq a well my on negative comment i that the film i so one side it could be easily passe off a left wing propaganda not by me mind you but by those aim to credit the film and message a more balance point of view would speak to a large audience	positive
r43621	I agree with with of the messages on here that the book is not like the movie. I read the book as a sophomore in high school in Sumter SC. I instantly fell in love with the book and eagerly awaited the release of the mini series. As much as I liked the movie and thought it was very well done, I was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book. I was glad the Orry was not killed off like he was in Love and War or N&S II.<br /><br />Having grown up in SC and graduating from University of SC, I fell in love with southern history because of this mini series and book. I had the honor of meeting John Jakes at a symposium in 1988 at USC. I stayed around afterwards and meet Mr.Jakes. Unfortunately, I did not get to ask him a question. But meeting him was honor enough. I majored in accounting but got my minor in Southern Studies. In addition, I patterned a lot of my mannerisms after Orry Main. Orry and myself are very much alike. I feel I was born 150 years too late. I am a southern gentleman and very proud of this.<br /><br />Well I fell in love with 2 women in the movie....Genie Francis and Wendy Kilbourne. Man, did I have the hots for Wendy!!!! I never quite could find a real life version of her. I hope one day too!!!	i agree with with of the message on here that the book i not like the movie i read the book a a sophomore in high school in Sumter SC i instant fell in love with the book and eager await the release of the mini series a much a i like the movie and thought it was very well done i was appoint that the movie did not follow the book i was glad the was not kill off like he was in love and war or n s ii have grown up in SC and graduate from university of SC i fell in love with southern history because of this mini series and book i had the honor of meeting john at a symposium in at i stay around afterward and meet Mr fortunate i did not get to ask him a question but meeting him was honor enough i major in accounting but got my minor in southern study in addition i pattern a lot of my mannerism aft main and myself are very much alike i feel i was born year too late i am a southern gentleman and very proud of this well i fell in love with 2 women in the movie genie Francis and Wendy man did i have the hots for Wendy i never quite could find a real life version of h i hope one day too	positive
r47127	"No doubt, when Madonna and Guy Ritchie married, it was because they both thought it would help their movie careers. If you've been through the ordeal of watching ""Swept Away,"" then you know at that level it was a match made in hell. After nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress (or ""octress"" as she might have pronounced it in ""The Next Best Thing""), she still can't get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent. And that's the thing that makes people dislike her so much on the screen: that gut feeling that her ego is so inflated that it prevents her from being able to just let go and connect with her audience. If there's any justice in this universe, she just blew her last chance."	no doubt when Madonna and guy married it was because they both thought it would help their movie career if you been through the ordeal of watch swept away then you know at that level it was a match made in hell aft near year of trying to become a respect actress or a she might have pronounce it in the next best thing she still can t get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent and that s the thing that make people like h so much on the screen that gut feeling that h ego i so inflate that it prevent h from being able to just let go and connect with h audience if there s any justice in this universe she just blew h last chance	negative
r16230	"It's interesting that someone made a comparison of the ""Fifth Missile"" to the Star Trek episode. It should be pointed out that the original Star Trek TV episode in which the crew of the Enterprise undergoes a space madness while orbiting planet Si 2000 is entitled ""The Naked Time"", not the ""Naked Now"". The ""Naked Now"" refers to the first regular Star Trek The Next Generation episode in which the Enterprise-D encounters a science vessel. This episode, though, does refer to and is based on the ""Naked Time"" original series one.<br /><br />Now, to the Firth Missile. While the reactions of the crew in the Star Trek episodes were based on those similar to alcohol intoxication, the crew's condition on board the Montana was caused by a much more serious situation, namely the paint vapors emitted by the faulty bulkhead finish. There are few places where such a reaction could have more serious consequences than among a crew who has responsibilities as serious as a crew on a ballistic missile submarine, and of course this is what makes the film so suspenseful and such a thriller. The plot is very believable. At the same time, this film, along with ""Crimson Tide"", ""The Day After"", ""By Dawn's Early Light"", ""The Hunt For Red October"", ""Ice Station Zebra"", and many other similar movies give us much insight into how easily things could go wrong and just how easy it could be for a nuclear holocaust to begin. Thankfully such an event has not occurred and (God willing) such an event will not happen."	it s interesting that someone made a comparison of the fifth missile to the star trek episode it should be pointed out that the original star trek TV episode in which the crew of the enterprise undergoes a space madness while orbit planet Si i entitle the naked time not the naked now the naked now ref to the first regular star trek the next generation episode in which the enterprise d encounter a science vessel this episode though does refer to and i base on the naked time original series one now to the firth missile while the action of the crew in the star trek episode were base on those similar to alcohol intoxication the crew s condition on board the Montana was cause by a much more serious situation namely the paint vapor emitted by the faulty bulkhead finish there are few place where such a action could have more serious consequence than among a crew who ha responsibility a serious a a crew on a ballistic missile submarine and of course this i what make the film so suspenseful and such a thriller the plot i very believable at the same time this film along with crimson tide the day aft by dawn s early light the hunt for red October ice station zebra and many other similar movie give u much insight to how easily the could go wrong and just how easy it could be for a nuclear holocaust to begin thankful such an event ha not occurred and god willing such an event will not happen	positive

r10919	Imagine pulling back the mask of a lethal assassin and finding Barbara Cartland there... that's what happens with this film.<br /><br />The opening showed promise, but soon it drops all pretenses of being a thriller (or even an imaginative love story) and the only reason they made this story becomes abundantly clear: to fill a gap in their female viewing market by creating yet another re-hash of 'mis-understood, brooding bad-boy' (Andrei) meets 'innocent, whimsical beauty' (Paula). <br /><br />Rather than waste any time in creating an original premise, the filmmakers went straight for the money-shot: the bad boy being tamed by said whimsical beauty. Thence follows a string of insincere and heavily-clichéd love scenes sprinkled with pseudo philosophical/poetic fluff. Andrei's admission of being (eponymously) a 'poet' is levered in to round out the perceived qualities a Byronic hero should have - but even when we're told in heavy, underlined writing who and what he is, it's still difficult to believe it - or care.<br /><br />For a Byronic hero/antihero to work, the story needs subtlety, style and innovation - all of which are utterly absent here. This is not a modern day Phantom of the Opera, it's just what happens when a weak and rather silly woman (with loose knicker elastic) dates a bad man, who, after meeting her, seems as dangerous as bunny slippers.<br /><br />The performances might have saved this film, had they been any good: the female lead is preoccupied with looking sexy and 'otherworldly', no matter how forced or ridiculous; and poor Dougray Scott appears to have been drugged as he shambles through his part. This is not his best work. The glimmers of interest were brought by Jürgen Prochnow as 'Vashon', and Andrew Lee Potts as the young photographer/brother. A better movie would have offed the sister and kept the brother instead.	imagine pull back the mask of a lethal assassin and finding Barbara there that s what happen with this film the opening show promise but soon it drop all pretense of being a thriller or even an imaginative love story and the on reason they made this story become abundant clear to fill a gap in their female viewing market by create yet another re hash of understood brooding bad boy Andrei meet innocent whimsical beauty Paula rather than waste any time in create an original premise the filmmaker went straight for the money shot the bad boy being tamed by said whimsical beauty thence follow a string of sincere and heavily love scene sprinkle with pseudo philosophical poetic fluff Andrei s admission of being a poet i lever in to round out the perceived quality a Byronic hero should have but even when we re told in heavy underline writing who and what he i it s still difficult to believe it or care for a Byronic hero antihero to work the story need subtlety style and innovation all of which are utter absent here this i not a modern day phantom of the opera it s just what happen when a weak and rather silly woman with loose knicker elastic date a bad man who aft meeting h seem a dangerous a bunny slipper the performance might have saved this film had they been any good the female lead i preoccupy with look sexy and otherworldly no matter how forced or ridiculous and poor Scott appear to have been drugged a he shambles through hi part this i not hi best work the glimmer of interest were brought by a and Andrew lee Potts a the young photographer brother a better movie would have off the sister and kept the brother instead	negative
r49209	An American boy goes to Paris after his mother commits suicide, becomes and artist and then discovers himself and returns to the States so he can make things right with his former friends.<br /><br />I have to think that the people who are rating this movie so highly are all X-Files fans, even though there are no aliens or serial killers in it. Don't be fooled, this movie blows chunks.<br /><br />The story is incoherent, with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why. When you do get an explanation, it doesn't fit the story that went before it. What it does is bore you. For all the acting talent in the film, it just isn't interesting. I spent the whole movie wondering when sex-addict Duchovny was going to bang someone. Maybe he was doing it behind the scenes; they should have filmed that instead.<br /><br />What comes across is a story of a self-obsessed artist worrying about minor incidents in his life and wanting to make them right somehow - even though they didn't seem that wrong to begin with. There aren't any particularly interesting or shocking revelations, despite the mention of a big secret in the first few minutes. It's just a guy thinking that his life is as interesting to you as it is to him. It's not.<br /><br />I saw in the trivia that Duchovny claims he wrote the script in a week, that's entirely believable. The guy can act, there's no doubt, but writing and directing are obviously beyond his talents.<br /><br />Why Hollywood keeps greenlighting these self-discovery stories is beyond me. I discover myself in the shower every morning but I don't bother making a movie about it. Mine would probably be better than this one, though; at least there would be some nudity.	an American boy goes to Paris aft hi mother commit suicide become and artist and then cover himself and turn to the state so he can make the right with hi former friend i have to think that the people who are rating this movie so high are all x file fan even though there are no alien or serial kill in it don t be fool this movie blow chunk the story i coherent with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why when you do get an explanation it t fit the story that went before it what it does i bore you for all the acting talent in the film it just t interesting i spent the whole movie wondering when sex addict was going to bang someone maybe he was doing it behind the scene they should have film that instead what come across i a story of a self obsess artist worrying about minor incident in hi life and want to make them right somehow even though they t seem that wrong to begin with there t any particular interesting or shocking revelation despite the mention of a big secret in the first few minute it s just a guy think that hi life i a interesting to you a it i to him it s not i saw in the trivia that claim he wrote the script in a week that s entire believable the guy can act there s no doubt but writing and direct are obvious beyond hi talent why Hollywood keep these self discovery story i beyond me i discover myself in the shower every morning but i don t bother making a movie about it mine would probably be better than this one though at least there would be some nudity	negative
